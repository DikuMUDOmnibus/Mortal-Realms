Mortal Realms (MrMUD) - Install ReadMe	|
					|
Written by Emperor 1999			|
________________________________________|

  The Mortal Realms package includes source code, and several basic areas.
These basic areas are provided for reference, as several utilize the
advanced features of MR.  The basic package provided does not immediately
boot up, and requires some work as to setting up area files, and
compilation.  The following describes a quick overview as to how this is
accomplished.
  Enjoy, Dave.


MRTRMSRC.ZIP - The source code for MrTerm v1.61 in Borland C v5 format.
               Written in ANSI C compatible mode, so readily convertable.
               Zipped using MS compatible ZIP format.

MRMUDSRC14.TAR.GZ - The source code and basic areas for MR.
                    Last compilation was ported to RedHat Unix.
                    Has been ported to Solaris, SunOS, Linux, FreeBSD, and RedHat.



	HOW DO I COMPILE MORTAL REALMS?
	-------------------------------

To compile Mortal Realms, cd to the src directory and type:

	make

Then cd to the mrmud/bin directory and type:

	cp md current_md

and
	cp md next_md


	HOW DO I RUN MORTAL REALMS?
	---------------------------

To run Mortal Realms, cd back to the src directory and type:

	./startup &

Make sure that you have edited the startup file and supplied the
appropriate port number.


	THE STARTUP FAILED. HOW DO I FIX IT?
	------------------------------------

If the startup fails (aborts), it may be because of bugs in the
standard area files. Try the following:

	* cd to the mrmud/area_current directory

	* In the file called area.lst, remove gahld.are and chakkor2.are.
	Also, change the position of the area files such that midgaard.are 
	is referenced before chakkor.are. 

Remember that you can view problems with the startup by accessing
the log files stored in the mrmud/log directory.


	HOW DO I GET RID OF THAT TEST GAME MESSAGE?
	--------------------------------------------

In the comm.c file, there is a block of code that looks like this:

   if (port == 4321 )
     {
     REAL_GAME = TRUE;
     TEST_GAME = FALSE;
     }
   else
     {
     REAL_GAME = FALSE;
     TEST_GAME = TRUE;
     }

Simply change the port number to whatever will be the port number for 
your real game.


	WHO DO I LOGIN AS?
	------------------

You can login for the first time as Chaos (level 99 God). His password is 
initially blank.


	HOW DO I USE EXTERNAL FILES?
	----------------------------

External files are BMPs, JPGs, WAVs, and MIDs that can be referenced and
used by players with MrTerm capability.  Place these files in the 
./area_current/data directory.  The builder.doc file describes how to
include these files into areas, along with the other advanced features
of areas with MR.
