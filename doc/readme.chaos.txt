Hello,

  I thought I would jot down a few notes on this source code release.  Myself,
and Douglas Michael initially started Mortal Realms some time ago with the 
intent to create some nifty code.  We never dreamed that it would grow as it
did.  Dug retired some time back, and several other coders joined us at
various times.  John Till helped from numerous areas to several sections of
code.  Martin Gallwey helped quite a bit with areas and coding.  Scott Baldwin
also has some code here.  Regardless, we've grown quite a bit from the basic
550K of Merc 2.0 source code.  If you are a coder for an existing mud, feel
free to pillage this source to your heart's content.  If you are experimenting,
or starting a new mud, feel free to use this code, as is.  I would request
that your title screen have Dug and myself listed on the credits, along with
MrMud 1.4, and ofcourse the licensing you will be binded with requires the
Merc guys be listed.  Also in your credits section of help, please list
John, Martin, and Scott as additional coders.  

Enjoy, Chaos.
