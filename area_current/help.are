-1 DIKU~
.                    Original game idea, concept, and design:

	  Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
	  Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
	  Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
	  Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
	  Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

		     Additional contributions from:

Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
Ragnar Loenn    - the bulletin board.
Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
		  uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
		  in the process.

And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

Developed at: DIKU -- The Department of Computer Science
		      at the University of Copenhagen.

This product is no longer a DIKU or MERC system.
Through additions and changing of the format of playing style,
Mortal Realms is code named: MrMud 1.4 (based on MERC 2.1).

~

-1 HUMAN HUMANS HUMANINTRO~
In the beginning there were Humans, Elves and Ogres. Humans are the most
numerous and the plainest race in the Realms. Although possessing no special
abilities or bonuses, they are the most adaptable and flexible race. Humans 
are bipedal creatures with two arms and a roundish head. Their height, 
weight, eye and hair color vary greatly. It is rare to find any two who 
look exactly alike. 
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS HALFLINGINTRO~
.  Stout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level
of dexterity which is only equal to his wit. Many enjoy the thrill of
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire. Many halflings,
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well. This intelligence, coupled by a surprising
determination makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered)
ally.
  Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and usually have
very hairy feet. Eye color range from blue, brown, green, and any shade
in between.
~

-1 GNOME GNOMES GNOMEINTRO~
.  Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledges, magics
and religions.  Additionally, due to their familiarity with such
lore, they tend to be more resistant to magics.  They can, though,
suffer tremendously from physical attacks.
  Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well.)
  Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.
Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of
pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out to battle.
~

0 ELF ELVES ELFINTRO~
.  Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic.
  The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.
~

0 ORC ORCS ORCINTRO~
.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad bodies, their poor mental 
ability is offset by an iron constitution, coupled with abnormal strength.
Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to their human influence,
brute combat is is still the natural call which stirs in the soul of the 
Orc.  All Orcs possess infravision.
  Orcs are a broad and powerful race, with wide bodies, long bowed limbs
and a heavy musculature.  A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals 
small, squinting eyes; below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with 
crooked fangs; dark skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts 
civilized races.  Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two 
hundred pounds, an altogether fearsome race.
~

0 OGRE OGRES OGREINTRO~
.  The Ogre stands from six to nine feet tall in height and is known for 
its muscle-packed body that can weigh from three to four hundred pounds.  
Most are relatively hairless, their bodies are covered with small, boney 
growths, and their disproportionately long limbs gives them a somewhat 
simian appearance.
  Ogres inherit great physical attributes from their distant ancestry, wherein
lies the hints of giant blood. They have an aptitude for aggression, 
inherent infravision to assist in traversing darkness, and boast an awesome
strength.  Being territorial, most Ogres will readily engage in battle 
to establish superiority over any it encounters.  All in all a race best 
suited for the role of pure fighter.
~

-1 DROW DROWELVES DROWINTRO~
.  Drow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happy community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have long
since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.
  Drow have black skin and white hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.
  Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have innate infravision with
which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.
~

0 RANGER RANGERINTRO~
.  A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.  A
self-sufficent person, the ranger is adaptable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a ranger is physically skilled enough to take on most any
foe. A ranger typically travels light, but he does have the mighty strength 
of a warrior to carry equipment needed in his travels.  
  A ranger is the easiest class to learn for a person new to MUDs.
~

0 MONK MONKS MONKINTRO~
.  A monk is a mighty healer and protector of the weak.  Led with a mission
to heal and teach, Monks have many varied and sundry healing spells at their
command. Having spent many years in strict discipline and rigourous training,
Monks are adept at unarmed combat and refuse to bear weapons, preferring to
rely on their hands and feets. As a monk gains levels and experience, so
also do they gain further wisdom and knowledge in the arts of healing as 
well as in the arts of unarmed combat.
  The wisdom of the monk in the ways of magic and the art of healing, makes 
them a wonderful companion to those who gain their trust. Their fiercesome
abilities of fighting without weapons make them dangerous enemies.
  Monks are fairly easy to learn for players new to MUDs.
~

0 ROGUE ROGUES ROGUEINTRO~
.  The rogue is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society. Known to haunt the darkest roads and
alleys. The skills of the rogue reflect his way of life, be it sneaking,
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly backstabs. With amazing dexterity they have the ability to
circle around an enemy, but for living such a dark life, thieves have
always had a bad reputation so don't be suprised if you are always under
suspicion. Rogues start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as
backstab and circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A rogue is always
useful when there is  a lock that needs pryed, or an item that one wishes
to acquire without detection.
  Rogues are easy to learn for players new to MUDs.
~

0 ELEMENTALIST ELEMENTALISTS ELEMENTALISTINTRO~
.  The elementalist is one of the three greater schools of magic. From an early
age they are taught how to reach past the boundaries of the prime physical
plane and reach into the neighbouring elemental planes. This gives the
elementalist great power over their physical environment. They can summon
forth stone to cover their bodies with impenetrable armour, conjure forth
springs of refreshing water or fiercesome fire elementals to do their bidding.
  Elementalists have so much control over their physical environment, they are
note restricted to casting spells in their current room, they can range cast
them into the surrounding area!
  Elementalists are hard to learn by new players to MUDs.
~

0 ILLUSIONIST ILLUSIONISTS ILLUSIONISTINTRO~
.  The greater school of Illusion is greatly respected throughout the land, for
within, it's members learn the most destructive spells magic can offer. They
fight along side warriors, combining magick and steel in a synergy of raw
energy. 
  Illusionists are capable of confusing and demoralising their enemies with a
range of spells of deception, causing hallucinations, blindness and even
madness.
  Illusionists are slightly hard to learn by new players to MUDs.
~

0 NECROMANCER NECROMANCERS NECROMANCERINTRO~
.  Necromancers are the most scholarly of the greater schools of magic, and have
spent millenia furthering the knowledge of their guild. As a result, they have
at their control, some of the most powerful spells in the world. Necromancers
can bend the fabric of the universe to suit their desires, allowing them to
transfer objects and people across vast distances, magically. They can even
open semi-permenant rifts in space and time visible only to the trained eye.
  Necromancers also study the nature of death, and are capable of giving some 
form of twisted life force back into the bodies of the slain, as well as
tap the life force of other living creatures.
  Necromancers are very hard to learn for new players to MUDs.
~

0 ASSASSIN ASSASSINS ASSASSININTRO~
.  Assassins are the members of the darkest profession, and are generally
shunned by the more reputable members of society. They learn the art of killing
while unseen, and have developed many skills to allow them to sneak around
unseen, and unheard. 
  The Assassin is the hardest class to learn for new players to MUDs.

0 WRITE~
Syntax: cast "write"
  The write spell changes a scroll into a random spell.  The spell is any that
the caster knows, including spells from other class's that the caster has
previously been.  The caster must be holding the scroll which he wishes to
write upon.  Any spells that may be upon the scroll when "write" is cast will
be erased.
  See also CAST, READ, IDENTIFY.

  - stealth and hide fixed            - back to one pet at a time
  - rcast acts a little different     - voice is a bit more subtle
  - rips and rifts changed slightly   - save glitch fixed
  - all magical items are now marked  * you can now refer to a corpse by name
  - fixed item bug

~

0 STOP~
Syntax: stop [all, invis, hide, stealth, sneak, hunt, clear, disguise]

  This stops the person from using skills and spells that were started
  by the same person.  It works for hunt, invisibility, stealth, hide,
  sneak, ect.
  This is also used to stop the CONTINUOUS command.
    See also INVISIBILITY, STEALTH, HIDE, HUNT, CONTINUOUS.
~

0 CONTINUOUS~
Syntax: continuous <command>

  This command starts up a timed response system.  It simply issues the command
  you enter after the 'continuous' every 10 seconds.  The player is not allowed
  to enter any other commands while in continuous mode.  The only way to stop
  the continuous mode is with the STOP command.

  This command would be good for a screen saver, or waiting for someone, and
  not wishing to repeat the WHO command continually.

    See also:  STOP, REPEAT.
~

0 SPEAK~
Syntax: speak <race>

The SPEAK command changes the player's current language that they are 
speaking in.  Only the known languages of the player may be switched to.

  (A)  Languages
  (-)  Back
{a}language
{-}communication
~
-1 LANGUAGE~
  Languages

Characters initially recieve the language of the character's race and two
other random languages.  After a character reaches 10th level a new language
is added.  This continues every 10 levels until all languages are known.

When a character tries to speak to another character, it will only work if the
speaker's current language (set by SPEAK) is one that is known by the listener.
If the listener does not understand, the speaker and the listener are notified
that they are not speaking the same language.  The WHO command lists all the
languages known by each character so that the correct language may be found.
Monsters, and other beings in the game will only notify you that they are
speaking the wrong language if they try to talk to you or you use the TELL to
talk to them.

There are several commands, spells, and skills to get around the problem of
language barriers, but these are not initially given to the player.

  (A)  SPEAK
  (-)  Back



{a}speak

0 TRACK~
Syntax: track
  This is allows the Ranger to determine who has recently left a room
  by the tracks left in the ground, and which way they left.
  The tracks are shown in top to bottom order of oldest to newest.
    See also HUNT, NOTICE, CLEAR PATH.
~
0 HOMONCULOUS~
Syntax: cast homonculous
  The Homonculous spell creates a small creature (2nd level) that the
  conciousness of the caster is moved into.  The caster becomes the creature
  and can do anything he pleases.  The Homonculous can be left by using the
  RETURN command at any time.  If the Homonculous dies while the caster is
  switched, then the caster will be damaged quite a bit.
    See also CAST, MANA, SHADE.
~

0 DEMON SHADE BEAST PHANTASM~
Syntax: cast demon
        cast shade
        cast beast
        cast phantasm
  These spells create different type of creatures that can be controlled by
  the caster.  Each creature has his own attriubtes.  You may only have 1 of
  any of these creations at a time.

  Shadow Beast:  Strong but fights 1 battle.                2/3 Level of Caster
  Shade: Fairly weak, but is orderable.                     1/2 Level of Caster
  Phantasmal Killer: Hit usually is death, 1 battle.        1/4 Level of Caster
  Demon: Very strong, but may attack caster.                3/4 Level of Caster
		 4/3 Level of caster if demon spell fails (1/3 fail).
    See also CAST, MANA, HOMONCULOUS.
~

0 'ANIMATE DEAD'~
Syntax: cast 'animate dead'

    This spell takes the first corpse in the room and makes it a zombie to
    follow the spell caster.  The corpse must be of a non-player corpse.
    The level of the zombie will be the same as the level of the creature
    that left the corpse, although the stats will be determined by how strong
    zombies are.

~

0 REARM~
Syntax: none
  This command allows the Ranger to automatically rearm himself, if in
  combat he gets disarmed.  This command is automatic if the skill is known.
    See also HUNT, TRACK, NOTICE, DISARM.
~

0 NOTICE~
Syntax: notice

  out and found.  It will find creatures that are hiding or disguised.
  It finds "someone" when there is an invisible creature.
    See also TRACK, HUNT, REARM.
~

0 HUNT~
Syntax: hunt

  combat.  It only works if it is the last creature to be fought in a
  battle.  This command may be stopped by using the STOP command.

-1 STORY~
In the beginning, there were mortals.  They lacked direction, and soon
Chaos and Order entered their realm, to provide them with a sense of
purpose, and motivation.  It wasn't that easy though.  Chaos and Order
were sentient, and developed plans of their owns.  

Chaos' plan was to wreak havoc amongst the mortals, while Order's
intent was to see that commerce and diplomacy reigned throughout the
realm.  The two plans were complete opposites, and so both Chaos and
Order surrounded themselves with mortal followers of the same beliefs,
and wars raged for eons.

The funny thing about wars is that, no matter how hard you try to
keep everything predictable, events unfold along paths that are
completely unforeseen, even amongst the gods.  Neither Chaos nor
Order could've predicted that their conflict would bring about yet
another god, Demise.

Every time a mortal perished, Demise was there to take away a part
of their life's experiences.  When satisfied, the mortal's soul would
be passed on to one of Demise's spawnings, Death.  Death would look
into the soul and record the fate of the mortal in the Tome of Mortal
History, and then return the soul from oblivion to the realm above.

Chaos and Order were not content with the existence of another god,
so they combined their powers to bind Demise in a temple, far away
from the lands of mortals, thinking they had destroyed all Demise 
had stood for, and they continued to wage their war.  Every once in
a while they would mock Demise by taking one of their traitorous
followers and force them along the path of Demise, where the mortal
would be hunted and persecuted by all other mortals, until they
finally passed into oblivion forever, which is where Death dwelt.

Death was overlooked by Chaos and Order.  While Demise was in full
power, Death had the simple tasks of recording someone's demise, and
would then return their soul to the realm of mortals.  With Demise
gone, Death had to take on new responsibilities, and thus grew as
powerful as Demise ever was. 

But Death was content to wait in oblivion for new souls to visit.
The war between Chaos and Order was raging, and Death was a busy god.

Until recently...

Death was growing impatient.  Now don't get me wrong.  It's not like IT
wasn't keeping busy, but it just wasn't like in the old days, when hundreds
of mortals would visit IT from the realms above, and pay their dues to
oblivion.  Now, only a handful of mortals would make the journey, and IT
was not satisfied.

Then Death had a thought.  What if IT journeyed to the surface, into the realm
of mortals?  Rumors had seeped down that Order was nowhere to be found, and
that Order's followers had lost their sense of purpose.  Chaos, however,
had not left the realm, and Chaos' followers were strong.  They would oppose
Death's entrance into their world, as IT was endowed with the same strengths
and powers as each of the other gods.

But IT had considered this possibility, and had weighed the positives
against the negatives.  If the mortals opposed IT, IT could teach them the
truth of ITs name.  If the gods opposed Death, they would not be able to 
overpower IT as they had Demise, for Order was nowhere in the realm.

And so it would be...

Death would bring back the true meaning of Mortal to Mortal Realms.

-1 GODS~
There are two gods in Mortal Realms:  Order and Chaos.
These two gods will assist players, when they the Gods feel so inclined.
Each of these gods exact a price, but of the two, Chaos usually has a higher
price, but a larger amount of benefits.
A mortal player may select to pledge to be a follower of one of these Gods.
If a player pledges, then that God can help significantly more than normally
allowed.  Yet, if a player asks for help from a God he did not pledge to, after
pledging, then he might be ignored, have to pay more for help, etc...

The game itself is set up where Gods are not a required, or wanted part of the
game.  Characters cannot advance to high level and become a god.  The levels
in this game go up to 95.  Although as a player advances, he gets new skills,
and other very good strengths, even at the higher levels.  At very high levels
he has equivalent strength of a demi-god, yet he is still mortal.
Allowing no character Gods is one of the basic premisses of this game, and it
will not change.  But then I've always found it more fun to be mortal...
     Thank you for playing, Chaos.

0 INTERP INTERPRETER~
The interpretor of Mortal Realms includes many advanced features:
1)  The ALIAS command can make redefined commands of multiple lines
    and including arguments inside the alias.
2)  The use of the '!' or '.' command repeats the previous command.
3)  '!' followed by a letter repeats the last line that started with that letter
4)  The use of the '&' character will create one line of code that is
    executed simultaneously.
5)  All commands, and names of people, creatures, and objects may be referenced
    by the first letters that match with their actual name.
6)  Scroll back buffer allows looking at previous screens.  see HELP BUFFER
7)  On any given entry, you may enter up to 8 lines of text.
8)  Commands that start with a number are repeats.
  example:
      t cha I have a question for you. & say How are you?
  executes as:
      You tell Chaos 'I have a question for you.'
      You say 'How are you?'
  if you follow with:
      !
  executes as:
      You say 'How are you?'
~

0 BUFFER~
Syntax: buffer [<pages>]

  The buffer command utilizes 20k of ram for each player, recording all data
that goes to the screen.  The scroll back buffer allows the player to view
text that has scrolled of the page.
  Use of the <pages> is optional.  Without it, the default is the previous
page.  When the user specifies a number, the page displayed will be the amount
of pages back that the player specified.  The actual amount of pages depends on
the amount of text on each page, with the minimum amount of pages stored being
16, up to a nominal maximum of 64 pages.
  BUFFER 0 will redisplay the current page.
  The size of each page is fixed by the size of the VT102 screen, regardless
whether the player is utilizing VT102.  If the player wishes to change the page
size and is not using VT102, then simply change the VT102 size.
  The calculation of amount of lines does not consider lines over 80 characters,
so the PAGER may pause the screen.

0 STATS~
There are 5 primary attributes for each character: 
  Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Constitution
Each stat has a maximum value described by what level the character is and what
class the character is.  Also there is a modified maximum based on the level
that allows magic items to modify the stats to a higher than allowable value.
Each classes primary attribute may be 3 points higher than the other stats:
  Illusionist = intelligence          Elementalist = wisdom
  Ranger      = constitution          Rogue        = dexterity
  Necromancer = wisdom                Monk         = strength
  Assassin    = dexterity
The maximum attribute based on magic goes up slower than the maximum attribute
based on actual stats.  These numbers change frequently to reflect your level,
class, and items held, wielded, or worn.
  Strength     - modifies how often and strong hits are, total weight carried.
  Dexterity    - modifies your armor class, total items carried.
  Intelligence - modifies how often a spell fails, amount pracs req'd to adept.
  Wisdom       - modifies mana usage per spell, amount of pracs each level, and
		   mana gained per tick.
  Constitution - modifies Hitpoints gained per level, and per tick.

~
0 SUICIDE~
Syntax: SUICIDE <password>

  The suicide command will let you kill yourself.  This will not cost any
experience, but it does cause you to die.  This is useful if you are caught
in a room that is impossible to leave.  After committing suicide, the player
is suggested to visit the morgue to retrieve your items.

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

~



0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back your death room.
Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you (God wants you
to have your gold).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  If you are first level, the amount you
lose is half-way back to the beginning of your level.  Higher levels take you
back to what you should have had to gain your last level, unless you have the
PLAYER KILLER flag.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses fall to the ground.
Objects on the ground are quickly picked up by scavenging creatures.
Non-player corpses last about 5 hours of game time (5 minutes of real time).
Player corpses last *roughly* 15 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

Syntax: DEATH
  The death command sets where you will die, or recall reset to.  This can
only be done at specific locations, depending on which god you follow, if any.
The room will say "You feel safe here" when you may set your death room.

Simply type 'DEATH' in the appropriate room and it is set there.

~
0 KILLER THIEF~
There are two flags that can show up in the WHO list that mark you as an
unsociable character.  These are (KILLER) and (THIEF).
You may only player kill or steal if both you and the victim are followers of
one of the gods, and they are different gods.

A KILLER is someone that used the MURDER command to attack another player.  A
player killer (PK) is totally legal, as is player thief (PT), but there are some
serious restrictions on them.  When you are a player killer, the city guards
will all try to kill you on sight (although it is rumored that guards aren't
that quick or perceptive).  Also, when you die, with the player killer
flag you not only lose experience back to the start of your current level, but
also all the way back to the start of the previous level.  You will become a
KILLER even if the person you try to murder is a KILLER.  The flag is removed
on death or over a period of time.

A THIEF is someone that tried to steal from another player and failed.  This
has no real effect on the game, except it shows up on the WHO list, so you are
tagged as a social deviant.  If you die, or gain a level, the flag will go away.
When a THIEF dies, they lose 2 levels worth of experience like a KILLER does.
A player thief must steal only from those lower level than them.

Any pure ASSASSIN with a KILLER flag is game for anyone to murder.  The only
restriction on who can murder them is the age of the attacking character
(must be at least 19 years of age).  Pure ASSASSIN's who are level 95 and
have a KILLER flag are not able to be attacked by non-aligned players.
    See also EXPERIENCE, DAMAGE, LEVEL, MURDER, STEAL, DEATH, CORPSE, HISTORY.
~


0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.
The experience required to gain a level will vary from class to class.
You gain experience by:
    being part of a group that kills a monster - level of monster
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat                 - based on level
    recalling out of combat             - based on level
    being the target of certain spells
    dying                               - returns to 1 over required for
					  current level
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.  A monster that is 30 levels above your level
regardless if you are in a group will double the amount of experience gained,
while a monster 20 levels below you will halve the experience gained.

The LEVEL command will show your current experience in relation to other
levels of characters in your class.

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lost them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.

~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 60 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 50 minutes.  The arena resets in 5 minutes.
Also note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet.
    See also TIME, CLOCK.
~



0 ! .~
Syntax: !

'!' or '.' repeats the last command you typed.
    See also VT102, ALIAS, INTERP.
~

0 GREP ?~
Syntax: grep <word>
Syntax: ? <word>

  The GREP command, similar to the unix command, searches through the scroll
back buffer and locates lines that contains the <word>.  The system is case
independant, and finds the last 10 cases.
  The '?' command may be used in replace of the word 'GREP'.
  This is very useful in showing things like the recent conversation you have
had with another player, and can be found by using the players name for the word
search.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
    See also MOVEMENT, RANGED, LOOK, SPEED.
~

0 MOVEMENT~
Movement on the MrMud system is based on "Rooms".  Each room is a small area
that all the action takes place in.  Nearly all commands work only inside of
the room you are in.  To move around the realm, use the "north", "south",
"east", "west", "up" and "down" commands.  Movement has a specific delay that
may be changed by using the SPEED command.  Special types of movement involve
using skills or spells, such as RECALL, FLEE, or TELEPORT.  Each of these types
commands has a specific help page for them.
There are several commands that work outside your current room, such as TELL,
ETELL, SHOUT, GTELL, RCAST, and SHOOT.  These also have specific help pages and
may be a skill, spell, or an ability inherent in every character.
    See also NORTH, RCAST, SPEED, RECALL.
~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast [<percentage>] [']<spell>['] [<target>]

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.
The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.
If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.
When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.
Casting as a multi-class character casts at the level of the spells caster's
class. (Example:  10th level Ranger and 8th level Illusionist would cast
"Burning Hands" as a 8th level caster, not an 18th level caster)
A defensive spell is limited to affecting only those with a level over 60% of
the spell's level.  This means the previous example would limit defensive
spells to characters above 4th level.
  Spell strength may be reduced by the addition of a percentage in front of the
spell name.  This effectively reduces the level of the spell cast.  Control of
spell strength is not an exact science, so only expect it's accuracy to be
within about twenty percent.
    See also, help on individual spell names, MANA, RCAST, MASS.
~
0 MOVE00~
Syntax: move <skill>

MOVE, the command, will show you how much movement you will use on a skill that
you can do.  This value will be different for most players, even on the same
spell. 
~

0 MANA~
Syntax: mana <spell>

Mana is the unit of power that a spell caster uses when spells are cast.  Mana
will decrease with casting, and go up over a period of time.  Some spells or
items may increase a spell caster's mana.  Mana goes up every level for a
spell caster based on wisdom and intelligence.  Mana usage on each spell
decreases based on the level, and the wisdom of the spell caster.

When a spell fails the mana usage is half of normal usage.  If the spell is
successful, but the target of an offensive spell 'saves' then the mana is not
divided by 2.

MANA, the command, will show you how much mana you will use on a spell that
you can cast.  This value will be different for most players, even on the same
spell. 
    See also CAST, RCAST, MASS, STATS.
~
0 RCAST 'RANGE CASTING'~
Syntax: cast <direction> <spell> <target>

Elementalists can cast their spells at a range of one room away.  It does cost
more mana to range cast than to simply cast.

If you want to cast 'chill touch' to the north at the fido you would type:
 > rcast n 'chill touch' fido
    See also, help on individual spells, CAST, MANA, MASS.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
    See also LOOK, OPEN, UNLOCK, PICK, CONFIG.

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
To get the second of a particular item, type '2.item'. For the third, type
'3.item', etc...
    See also EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
    See also SCORE, GET, CONFIG.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
    See also INVENTORY, GET.
~

0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KILL MURDER KICK~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill    [<character>]
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.
KILL without an option will kill the first creature in the room.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions of
murdering someone that is at least 3/4 your level, and you will be flagged as a
killer.  You must murder a creature that is charmed by another character.  You
may only murder another player if both you and the victim are followers of one
of the gods, and your god is different than your victim's god.  MURDER is the
ONLY way to start fighting another player, normal commands do not work on them.
After you have started fighting another player, you may use any skill or spell.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

NOTE: If you are a pure ROGUE and have "BACKSTAB" as an "auto" command, attempts
at murdering will be initiated as a backstab.

    See EXPERIENCE, LEVEL, DEATH, DAMAGE, REARM, KNIFE, CORPSE.
~

0 ASSASSINATE~
Syntax: assassinate <character> [<object>]

ASSASSINATE is a skill learned by Assassins that enables them to kill any
player character (within reason that is).  There are still level limitations,
but they are a bit less strict than those for murder.  Assassination is very
costly however, making it a skill that should be used wisely.  A major bene-
fit of ASSASSINATE is that it allows you to kill the player for a given
object.  The object, if takeable, will be given to the assassinator when the
assassinatee dies.

The cost of the ASSASSINATE command is 1/10th of the experience difference
between the assassinator's current level and his/her next level.

NOTE:  Other classes will not let their guildmembers (or former guildmembers)
ASSASSINATE.  So if you join or have ever been a part of another class, you
will not be allowed to ASSASSINATE.  Also, 95th level Assassin's cannot use
this skill because they are unable to gain experience.

See also: VICTORY.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
    See DIVERT, DISTRACT, RECALL, DEATH, CORPSE.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
    See also INVENTORY, EQUIPMENT, SCORE, GET.
~

0 SCAN~
Syntax: scan [<dirlist>]

SCAN lets you look each of the directions in <dirlist> order (neswud is
default order).

EXAMPLE: scan wens
lets you look west then east then north then south, letting you see what you
can in those directions.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
    See also CHARM, BUY, MURDER.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
  See also SLEEP SPELL, SPEED, MOVEMENT, NORTH.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL ETELL~
Syntax: gtell  <message>
Syntax: say    <message>
Syntax: tell   <character> <message>
Syntax: etell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
All of these commands depend on the fact that the speaker is talking in a
language that the listener can understand.
ETELL can be used in an emergency.  It acts the same as TELL, and ignores
languages altogether.  ETELL subtracts 1% of the experience of the character.

Syntax: note to      <to-list>     Syntax: note delete <number>
Syntax: note topic   [<topic#>]    Syntax: note reply <number>

NOTE LIST lists notes in the current topic which you can read.  If a numerical
<key> is specified then the last #key day's notes are listed ("note list 5"
shows all notes that were left in the past five days).  If a string <key> is
specified then messages with "key" in the subject or to-list will be listed.
If the string <key> is "new" then all of the notes that have been posted since
you last logged off will be listed. If you specify "note list unread" it will
show you how many unread notes you have under each topic.

NOTE READ reads one or all notes.  It is the default option (meaning that
a simple "note 5" will show you note #5, just like "note read 5" would do).

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players that can access the current
topic, and the recipient IMMORTAL means all immortals. 

NOTE WRITE puts you into edit mode, where you can easily enter your note
with use of some simple editor commands:
            /? - help    /s - save    /l - list    /c - clear

NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress;  NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading in the current topic.  Posting is not
automatic.  If you specify a <topic#> for POST, the note will go to the
specified topic.

NOTE REMOVE removes you from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE DELETE or ERASE removes the entire note if you are the sender.

NOTE TOPIC will list all of the note topics available to you.  If a <topic#>
is specified, then that topic will become the current topic for you.  The
topic is always reset to 0 when you enter the game.

NOTE REPLY will set up the "subject" and "to" portions of a note to reply to
the given numbered note (a reply goes to the sender and all recipients).
  Notes will be deleted after they are two weeks old.

NOTE NEXT will show you the next note in the current topic.

NOTE UNREAD will show you the next note that you haven't yet read. If you've
read all the notes in the current topic, it will cycle through the topics,
searching for a note that you haven't read yet.

~
0 SHOUT~
Syntax: shout    <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in your area.  To curb excessive
  shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

SHOUT will only be heard by someone that understands the language that you are
  speaking.

0 EMOTE POSE~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
  several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

EMOTE will only be understood by someone that can understand your race's
  language.  It does not matter which language the character is speaking.

POSE is a variant of EMOTE.  It performs a random action, based on the
  character's statistics.

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: remove all
Syntax: wear   <object> [<location>]
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.  You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its
alignment does not match yours, it is too heavy for you, or you are not
experienced enough to use it properly.  If a location is specified, wear will
only try to wear the object at the specified location (i.e. hands, neck).
WEAR ALL automatically picks the best equipment ( without magic affects ) to
wear, regardless if you are already wearing something.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.  REMOVE ALL puts all of your equipment in your inventory.

0 ALIAS~
Syntax: alias <command> <argument list>

Alias allows the you to define several of your own commands.  These must be
combinations of normal commands.  You are not limited to one normal command
per alias.  You may also have an optional argument inserted into the alias.
To add an alias you type 'alias' followed by the name of the new command
followed by the command list you want it to do.  You may insert an '&' to
separate individual commands.  You may also insert a '%' to include an
argument within the execution of your alias.
Example:
  alias m cast 'magic missile' % & say I got you, %  <enter> 
To use this alias, type the following:
  m fido <enter> 
This does the following:
  cast 'magic missile' fido
  say I got you, fido
ALIAS without an option will list your aliases. ALIAS with the same command
as a previous alias will change the previous alias.

0 CLASS MULTI MULTICLASS SKILLS~
Syntax: class <name>
Syntax: skills [all] [<class>]
Syntax: multiclass [all] [<name>] [<number range>] [god] [enemy]
  The multiclass system of Mortal Realms allows characters to advance, in a
limited fashion in each of the classes.  Changing classes is only allowed
when your level has reach a multiple of 10 (ex. 20,40,50...).  When your
level shows a multiple of 10, the CLASS command becomes active.  You may
only switch once per level, and then you may only switch into a class you
have not switched into before.  You cannot return to an old class.  Your
experience will be set to your actual level, but your skills will be at
level zero for the class you switched into (ex. Level 20 thief switches to
magic-user, and exp is the same as 20th level magic-user, while spell list
is that of zero level magic-user).   Most classes do not allow you to
practice anything at this initial level.  Half of your previous practices
are transferred to your new class.  Each race has 5 classes that they may
become, of the 7 total classes.
  CLASS without an option will list available classes.
  CLASS followed by a 3 letter class name will switch classes.
  SKILLS command lists the skills of your current class.
  SKILLS <class> list the skills of the class you select.
  SKILLS ALL lists all skills of all classes.
  MULTICLASS the command lists all the players classes, with options the same as
    the WHO command: <all> <range> <name> or <god> <enemy>.

0 VT102 REFRESH CLOCK~
Syntax: vt102 <on,off,##,bold,nobold,fast,slow>
Syntax: refresh
Syntax: clock <##,civ,mil>

Commands that deal with the vt102 support of the MERC interface.
Using these commands without an argument with give detailed help.
VT102 with no options will display help and current settings.
VT102 followed by 'on' will start the support mode.
VT102 followed by 'off' will turn off the support mode.
VT102 <number> will set the rows.  Ranges from 10-100 lines.  Default is 24.
VT102 support will display the main stats used, in real time, during play.
The FX at the top of the screen lists the first 2 letters of your affects.
There is also a clock in the right hand side of the display that works off
of 24 time.
The inclusion of the TACTICAL system has removed the option for top/bottom.
The Tactical system may be modified by slow/fast.  This is for terminals that
are not fully vt102 compliant.  Use slow, if garbage crops up during some
updates to the screen information.
REFRESH will fix the vt102 support if at any time it gets garbled.
CLOCK will set your clock to your particular time zone.
CLOCK with no options will give more help on how to use the command.
It is suggested that all players use vt102 support, where possible.
       If you recieve garbage, or have vertical problems, the rows may be set
       wrong, as this is a very common problem.  The second best guess is that
       your HOOK settings are wrong.
You may also turn of the tactical mode and use prompts by CONFIG -TACT.
    See also ALIAS, CONFIG, 'REFRESH SPELL', HOOK.
~
0 SPEED~
Syntax: speed <walk, normal, jog, run>

This command changes the rate at which you move.
Different rates also modify how much movement points you lose per move.
walk   - 1 mv lost per move
normal - normal mv lost per move
jog    - 1.5 times normal mv lost
run    - 2 times normal mv lost
Group leaders define how fast the group moves, and changes their rates
accordingly.
It is possible to run past aggressive creatures, but the faster you are
moving and the fewer people decide whether a party gets caught by them.

WHO ALL shows all of the people currently playing.
WHO without any arguments will list the people that you may follow or group.
WHO lists the players total level, current class, race, and known languages.
WHO always sorts out the list shown, for ease of reference.
WHO details each character's class, race, level, languages, title, and the

  follow a god, then it lists those that do not follow a god.
WHO ENEMY lists all of those that don't follow the same god as you.
WHO TARGET shows all the people you are allowed to murder.
With arguments, WHO can show players of certain levels or individuals by name.
For example:

~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.
GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight. After grouping you may have the leader follow another party
member to have essentially 2 leaders.
If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.
GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group, that
you can see.
You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within a few levels of
your own.  (Greater than 3/4 your level -2 and less than 5/4 your level +2)

You may use GROUP ALL to group all players that are currently following you.
You may use GROUP DISBAND to ungroup all players that are currently grouped
with you.

There is a small side effect of groups.  When a party attacks a creature, only
those in the group may later attack it, if everyone flees, until the creature
heals completely.  This means that no one may sneak in a kill your target.
Also, any change to the group formation will negate the ability to attack any
of these creatures, until they heal.

~


0 QUIT DELETE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: DELETE <password>

QUIT leaves the game.  When you re-enter the game you will be back in the
same room.
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

DELETE will permanently remove you character from the game.  you must include
your correct password to verify that you wish to delete your character.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.
RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

A recall scroll is required to recall, but does not need to be recited.

RECALL SET will change the destination of the recall to your current location.
RECALL RESET will reset your recall room to the game default, the temple.

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.

You may practice skills/spells from other guilds that you were a previous
member of at your current class guild for a penalty of costing 3 practices.

Practice sessions cost a small amount of gold per practice, which goes up
as the character advances in levels.
    See also LEVEL, EXPERIENCE, SCORE, TRAIN, Guild Names.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'move'|'mana'|'hp'|'prac'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.

Training Move, Mana, and Hp will increase those stats by a small amount.
Training Prac will trade Hitpoints for practices.  The costs for this is
5 hitpoints per train for one practice.  

After every 15 levels your maximum character stat goes up by 1.

advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~

97 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~

  Quick Overview:

  Mortal Realms is a fantasy role-playing game based in a medieval realm where
magic and strength guide the play of the many people in the game.
  The most important thing when first starting is to learn how to use the help
system.  This is described on the following page.
  Mortal Realm has many features that make it stand apart from the base code of
Merc 2.1.
  1) An advanced VT102 interface.
  2) Seven character classes and eight character races.
  3) A language based communication system.
  4) A complex city that the character may find all needs for adventure.
  5) A setup that allows MANY hours of play, with character levels to 95.
  6) Many new skills and abilities.
  7) Ranged skills and spells.
  8) Internet lagg minimizing system.  (even if not very effective)  %)
  9) Many new commands and features.
 10) Literally thousands of places to visit, and hundreds of creatures to
       encounter.
 11) Multi-classing system allowing many combinations of classes.

  Using HELP:

  The HELP system of Mortal Realms is fairly detailed and complete.  It is
required that the player have a firm grasp of how the system works before they
play.
  To initiate the help system just type "HELP" on the command line.  This will
bring up a menu of all the topics you can choose from.  Simple select the letter
associated with the option, and enter it alone on a line.
  Some items are not found in the menu system.  You may locate these by looking
at the Summary listing that is in the menu.  Each individual topic may be
directly indexed by typing "HELP <topic>".  Ex:   "HELP DRINK"
  The bottom few lines of most help screens will show a list of further topics
to find information on.  The topics are always related to the one currently
dispayed, and may help the character find a topic that is more specific than
the one that is currently displayed.  There may also be a menu listing.
  The HELP system may include statements with a "[" "]" around them.  These
are optional items.  If the statement has a "<" ">" around them, then it is
an argument that must be added to the command.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

		 Game Concepts:
Background:
   Mortal Realms places the player in the role of a medieval character in a
world filled with magic, combat, and many challenges to overcome.  The world
also has one distinct advantage to other fantasy role-playing type games, in
that the other players can be directly dealt with as if they were part of the
realm.  The game takes no difference, as to whether a person in the game is
a real person, or a computer generated one, although the real ones are generally
much smarter than the computer generated counterparts.
  Mortal Realms is also a game based on real-time, and therefore there is no way
to pause the game, or load a previous position.  Death or victory is permanent.
The game has a save command, but that is for internal use, in case the system
(which the creators try continuously to prevent) should run into a nasty problem
and crash.  The player should have no such fear of this happening under normal
situations.
  The game allows the player to choose from several classes when creating their
character.  The computer will randomly generate the stats for the character.
Although the player may not directly modify any of these stats during creation,
they may re-roll the stats and try for a better set.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

  The City of Chakkor:

  Much of game play will take part in the central city of Chakkor.  Since this
is the initial location of the player, after completing Mud School, there are
several HELP files dedicated to easing the process of locating shops and
guilds. (See HELP MAP in the game)  Mud School has no map and must be finished
blindly.  This will give the player a starting point to learning the game.
  The City of Chakkor contains several shops of magic, and also a scattering of
specialty shops that sell everything from arrows to water skins.  All these
shops can be easily used with several special commands that are dedicated to
shop use.  The player may even buy a pet for fun, or as a small assistance in
case they run into anything that wants to eat you.
  The city of Chakkor has many historical references placed throughout it's
interior, and the player may find it interesting to just explore around the
city.  The player may also notice that the city has a rather random layout on
the northern section, and a noticeably organized layout to the south.  This is
due to the occupation of the two religeons that are based in Chakkor.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.
{c}instruction05
{b}instruction03
~
-1 INSTRUCTION05~
  The World:

  The world of Mortal Realms, may be described in one word:  Huge.
The player will find that they spend much of the time in the game exploring
new areas of the game.  The lands outside of the city rarely change, and are
set up to allow specific levels of characters to go to specific areas.  Many
of the areas outside the city may be hostile.  There are also several other
cities in the game to explore, besides Chakkor.  Some players will find that the
other cities are a better place to base their adventures from than Chakkor.
  Most players will choose either to group up with several people to keep
accidental death to a minimum.  Some will choose to adventure and explore, and
either make maps, or just memorize the layout of the game.  It is generally
hard to determine where you are going if you are following in a party.  But
this in no way makes groups unwanted.  Nearly all adventuring takes place in
groups.
 
Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

  The Gods:
  Mortal Realms has a very unique system of religeon.  The player is never
allowed to advance to the status of a deity, but is given every oportunity
to advance their abilities instead.  There are only two gods that actively
enter the Realm:  Order and Chaos.  Both of these gods are the actual
programmers and law-makers of the rules of the game.  Their position is not
opposed to that of the players, but to make the game more detailed and
interesting.
  The religeous system allows a player, if they can reach a god, to become a
follower to that god.  There are some major considerations that they must look
at before deciding, and these can be looked up in the HELP system.
  The gods are usually EXTREMELY busy, but will make all attempts to help out
the players any way they see fit.  Players must realize that the gods cannot be
used to get information as to where items, creatures, etc. are located.  The
gods will generally not help with a character that dies either.  They are there
to oversee the game, and determine how best to set up the specific rules.
  The player must realize that the rules of the game are always going to be in
flux, and may even have bugs in the code.  Some players will find these bugs
and utilize them to their advantage.  This is the greatest of the sins a player
can make.  A player that reports the problems to the gods will considered the
greatest of the saints.
Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

		       Game Play:

  The interface or interpretor:

  Mortal Realms has a basic interperator that tries to figure out what you
ask it, and decides what to do from there.  Most commands are executed with the
following structure:  <verb> <noun>    or    <command> <target>
Some commands have very strange formats, and the HELP system will describe each
of these in detail.
  It is a very good advantage to be fairly skilled in typing when playing,
although that is not a limitation.  Many people have learned how to type by
playing a MUD based game.  Since most actions takes place in a continuous flow,
typing speed can help in those times when you are rushed to do something.
  Just about any of the commands can be shortened down to a few characters.  It
is suggested that the player start by using the first three letters to select a
command, and then possibly try out combinations of two and one character to find
short-cuts to typing out commands.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.
{c}instruction08

-1 INSTRUCTION08~

  There are three basic kinds of things that a player can do:
    Commands:  The commands that everyone in the game can do.
    Skills:  These are commands that only a given class can do.
    Socials:  These are commands that anyone can do, but have essentially no
		impact on the game.  They are for inter-player communication.
  There are commands to list all the commands, skills, and socials.  These
should be consulted often, until the player has a firm grasp on the majority.
  The player may also realize that only a very few are actually required to get
around in the game.  So do not think that not knowing all the commands will
not allow you to play.  Although the more commands that are known, the more
enhanced the player will be while interacting with the virtual game world.
  The player may find that he does the same commands repeatedly.  The alias
system may solve many of these problems for the player.
  There is also a scroll back buffer for those that do not have that capability
on their local terminals.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.
{c}instruction09
{b}instruction07
~
-1 INSTRUCTION09~
  Commands:
    Nearly every command has a different format as to how the arguments (the
text after the command name) are layed out.  Some commands have an open format,
like the commands that let you say things in the room.  Some commands have a
highly restrictive format, like the configuration commands.  The use of HELP is
required to determine the exact format of each command.

  Skills:
    The skills are commands that are ability that the character will learn over
time.  If the player becomes one of the four magic casting classes, then they
will learn spells instead of skills.  The spells will require large amounts of
a stat known as MANA.  Classes that are physical based, and use skills, will
require only MOVEMENT.  Each skill or spell can be found using the HELP system.

  Although the formats may appear strange at first, the player will readily get
used to them, and not require the use of the HELP system, exept as a reference.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

  Socials:
    These are commands such as "GRIN" or "LAUGH" that in general do not change
the play of the game.  They do convey a physical or emotional aspect to most
conversations with other players. Without these commands, most conversation will
appear dry, or have that "missing something" feel.  Socials are not found in the
HELP system, and must be tried individually.  There is a command that lists all
of the social commands.  Socials may be done at someone, ex. "GRIN BILBO".

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

			    The Character:

  The character has several primary components:
    1)  Personalization.        (Character name and title)
    2)  Background of study.    (Character class and race)
    3)  Statistics.             (Character attributes)
    4)  Languages.
    5)  Equipment.

  Each of these components should be understood and decided upon before
character generation should continue.  At any time, the character may quit his
character, until reaching 2nd level, and not expect the character to save.  This
also means that the player must be prepared to reach at least second level
immediately after character generation.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.
{c}instruction12
{b}instruction10
~
-1 INSTRUCTION12~
    Personalization:
  The format of Mortal Realms is a fantasy world, so the player may wish to
select a fantasy name.  Although the name must not be the same as another
character, or that of an item or creature in the game.
  To have gotten this far into the instructions, then it is obvious that you
have successfully entered a password.  You may later change your password if
desired.
  Characters have two other places where they may enter in a personalized
heading.  They have a title, which shows up in several places immediately after
the character's name.  They also have a description, which can be several lines,
and is displayed when another character looks at them.
  Players may wish to use some of the built in commands, such as ALIAS to
modify stock commands to do more personalized things.

    Background of the Character:
  Each player must select one of the seven given classes.  These classes define
what the character will have for a "job" in the fantasy world.  To complement
this, the character will also be assigned a random race.  The race may actually
be selected by rerolling the character several times.  Rerolling the character
will not change the class selection.
  The class of a character will define which of the stats should be highest
when deciding on when to keep a character.  The exact nature of what these
stats mean will be understood later in the game, and have little relevancy here.
Nearly all very low level characters perform about the same regardless of
their class or statistics.  As a character advances, the statistics become more
important.
  The race of a character defines who his parents were.  A character may be an
elf, drow, human, halfling, gnome, dwarf, orc or ogre.  Each of these slightly
modify some of the stats of the character, so in most cases, the final selection
of a good character for a particular class, will end up with a good choice of
race.  Race will effect some commands directly and each race will have a
unique ability or command that will usually increase in strength with level.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

    Statistics:
  Each character has 5 primary attributes, and several other statistics that
change throughout the game.  Each character may want to increase some of these
stats later, and Mud School gives the opportunity to modify some of the stats
immediately.  This lets the player personalize even the stats of the character.

  HIT POINTS (Hp) is an arbitrary number that defines how much damage a
character can take, before they die.  HP will increase with each level.
  MOVEMENT (Mv) is a number defining the amount of endurance a character has.
  MANA (Mn) is a number defining the magic power a character has.
  LEVEL (Lev) ranks each character against other characters in the game.
  EXPERIENCE (Exp) defines how far a player has advanced between each level.
  GOLD defines how much money a character has in gold pieces.  The player will
readily notice that the amount of gold carried is quite illogical, when at high
levels.  Gold has no real weight, and the player can assume the game runs on
credit.  Even when you die, you keep your gold.
  
Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.
{c}instruction15
{b}instruction13
~
-1 INSTRUCTION15~

  STRENGTH (Str) describes how strong a character is, a affects how hard an
apponent is hit.
  DEXTERITY (Dex) is assigned for the quickness of a character and affects how
hard the character is to hit by an opponenet.
  CONSTITUTION (Con) is a factor of the endurance of the character and affects
how quick the character recovers, after being hurt.
  INTELLIGENCE (Int) describes how much "book knowledge" a character has, and
effects a spell's chance to succeed.
  WISDOM (Wis) is a generic stat that describes how fast a character advances
with each level.  This is one of the most important stats to practice early.

  Each of these previous statistics can be temporarily changed by magic.  They
may also be changed permanently by training at one of the several training
halls.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

  Languages:

  Mortal Realms contains a system that each of the races (Halfling, Human, Elf,
Drow, Gnome, Dwarf, Orc, and Ogre) has their own distinct language.  Each
character starts out with three of these that includes the race of the
character.  The character, when talking to another character, will have to
choose a language to speak in.  Then the recieving party must be able to
understand the language that you are speaking in.  If this is successful, then
anything you type in to "say" will be displayed for them exactly.  It is not
necessarily true that both characters must be speaking in the same language.
  As a player advances in level, they will learn more languages.  There are
also a few spells that will enhance the player's ability to communicate.
  Nearly all commands that deal with comunication use some form of the language
system.  The major exception to this is a system for emergency communications.
In an emergency, the player may sacrifice some experience for talking to anyone.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

-1 INSTRUCTION17~
  Items and Equipment:

  The player will notice items on the ground that he wishes to use.  He may also
pick things up immediately from a kill, or buy items in a shop.  Regardless, the
character must transfer the item from his inventory to his equipment.
  When a player wears an item, it turns into equipment.  When it is in the
inventory, then it is just carried on the person.  The character must also have
the item in the inventory, not equipment, to drop the item.  There is a special
feature called sacrifice that purges an item from the room.  In this case, the
item must be on the floor.
  A player may drop an item, but must be aware that another character may come
along and take it.
  Each character has a limit on the amount of weight and items that they may
carry.  This will increase as the character advances.

Use the following commands:  STOP, BACK, or <Return> to continue.

0 PORT~
Syntax: port  [<block size>]

  The port command was developed to utilize a small feature of the Internet
that allows small packets to transfer quickly, and large packets to transfer
after a significant lag.  The port command breaks the text sent to the player
into blocks that are user defineable (default 2000).

  To minimize lag, reduce this number until lag eases up, but increase it if
response time is too slow.  This system has an optimum value, and lower values
work best for longer distance from the server.  Higher values for close
distances to the server.  There is no 'general' or optimal setting.  The user
will have to try several values within the range.

  This system is known to cause VT102 and ANSI systems to lose track of
cursor placement.  To solve this, use the maximum block size.

  The range of block size is:    16   to  2000

~
0 BEEP~
Syntax: BEEP [<name>]

  The beep command rings the VT102 bell on everyone in the room.
  With a name specified, it beeps the player.

0 COLOR~
Syntax: COLOR [on] [off]
Syntax: COLOR [<field number> <foreground color> <background color>]
Syntax: COLOR [reset]

  The color command both turns on and changes the color fields of the different
parts of the display.  To turn on the color functions, the terminal must support
ANSI colors, and be in VT102 mode.  The vt102 functions must also be activated.
COLOR ON turns on the color modes.
COLOR OFF turns them off.
COLOR RESET will return the colors to defaults.
COLOR by itself will list the various colors for each field.  It will also
    display the lines in the color that is listed for that field.
COLOR <field number> <foreground color> <background color> will change
    individual colors.
  The <field number> is a number that specifies some part of the screen.
  The <color> is the value for the color that you would like the
    <field number> to change to.

0 CORPSE~

  When a player dies a corpse is created at the spot where he died.  Then the
player awakens naked at one of three places in the city of Chakkor.  He will
have basically no items at all, and must work out a method of recovering the
lost items.
  The first place he should check is at the Morgue in the city, where he can
buy back his corpse.  It will show up in the room, where he can retrieve his
items.
  When a player gets the items from his corpse, the corpse will instantly decay.
The player that died is the ONLY person in the game that may take items out of
his own corpse.

  The game will save your corpse along with the character data, so that if the
game crashes before the player has a chance to get the corpse, it will not just
disappear.  Also the player may quit the game when he dies, because the corpse
will enter the game the same time the player does, even several days later.  The
corpse will ONLY start decaying if the player is on the game.  
~
0 ARENA~
The arena of Mortal Realms is located near the Assassin's Guild.

The arena is a place where ANYONE may enter to kill anyone else.  There are
no limitations there based on level or which god is followed.  Players may
enter to watch the proceedings.
Players will not be flagged as a player killer in this area.
You will NOT lose any experience while in the arena.
The morgue may be used for corpse recovery.
The player may locate the Arena Master and ask him to 'Leave', and he will
teleport you out of the Arena.  There is no other exit, except death.
When you die, you will revive at the entrance to the Arena.

Players may not RECALL in the Arena.
The player may locate the Arena Sprite for magical assistance, but he will not
help if he finds you.
The player may also be attacked by the Arena Beast, which is always slightly
stronger than the individual that he is attacking.

0 BET ACCEPT RESIGN~
Syntax:  BET <who> <how much>

These commands enforce a bet between two players in the Arena.  The only way
out of a bet once accepted, is to leave the Arena, quit the game, or die.
Regards, the only way out of the bet is to lose.

Betting yourself before someone accepts will cancel the bet.  You may bet as
many times as you like, with anyone in the Arena, until someone accepts a
bet.  Then you must go try to kill them, or otherwise get them to leave the
arena.

BET without any arguments gives a list of all bets currently offered, and
accepted.  It will also show whether the participants are actually fighting
each other.

RESIGN will immediately cause you to give up your bet.

Thanks for interest in creating areas for Mortal Realms.

The first thing you should do is get a copy of the documentation.
The current documentation is online at WWW site:

http://www.moe.ul.ie/-mrarea   - is a tilda

This will give you the builder and utility source code files. 
It also includes a new builder FAQ and other usful links.

If you still have questions feel free to contact an Area Admin.

Thanks for any help in advance, from Chaos and Order.

0 HISTORY~
Syntax: history

  The history commands gives everyone in the room a record of who you have
killed, and who has killed you.  This is just an interesting command, and has
no real impact on the game.

    See also:  KILLER, CORPSE, DEATH, DAMAGE.
~
0 NUMBER~
There are several ways to reference numbers and objects in Mortal Realms.
The examples that follow use the 'get' command as a reference.

1) Simple:           GET <object name>
   ex:   get arrow          - Gets first arrow.

2) Directed:         GET <item number of object refered to>.<object name>
   ex:   get 2.arrow        - Gets second arrow.

3) All:              GET ALL
   ex:   get all            - Gets everything.

4) All Directed:     GET ALL.<object name>
   ex:   get all.arrow      - Gets all of the arrows, leaving other objects.

5) Counted:          GET <amount> <object name>
   ex:   get 5 arrow        - Gets five of the arrows on the floor.

This system works for the following commands:
Give, Drop, Get, Steal, Buy, Sell, Put, etc...
Some commands may not have all methods available.
~

0 REPEAT~
Syntax: REPEAT <amount> <command string>
Syntax: <amount> <command string>

The REPEAT command will simply type in the input string for you the amount of
times specified by the amount variable.
This command is limited by the space in the input buffer, which is slightly
over 1200 characters.  Also the command is limited by 2 to 40 repeats.

The REPEAT command need not be typed out, since all command lines that start
with numbers are by default considered a repeat command.

example:  repeat 10 buy recall
  or
example:  10 buy recall
  Both of these would buy 10 recall scrolls, one at a time.

              Policy regarding character files

  The life of a character is totally dependant upon the player.  This means that
any problems with the character file will not be reasponsible by anyone
except that player.  Contacting anyone operating Mortal Realms in regards to
these types of problems will be viewed in bad taste.

The following is a list of common problems with character files.  All of these
items are considered the responsiblity of the player, and not the operators of
Mortal Realms.

  Accidental deletion and forgotten passwords  (Carelessness on part of the
      player)
  Changed passwords by outside parties  (Password requirements are deemed
      sufficient for purposes of security)  (Most commonly caused by compromised
      passwords, such as player sharing)
  Date expired characters  (Characters are deemed inactive after a time period
      based upon level)
  Uncontrollable deletion or corruption   (Although technically this could be
      considered error on the part of the operators or Mortal Realms, the life
      of the character is still responsible by the player.  All efforts will be
      made to fix the cause of the problem)

  The implementors are continually working to make playing at Mortal Realms a
fun and safe experience.  Although all players are advised that they play at
their own risk.

It may be of interest to the players some of the reasons for this policy:
         As of March 25, 1996.
  There are 22124 different computer addresses logged actively playing MR.
  There are 12232 total player files currently in the file sections.

Due to the massive quantities of characters and players at Mortal Realms, this
policy is deemed Law until further notice.  Hopefully the player can understand
and appreciate the significances and reasons behind this new policy.

Thank you for your time, Chaos.
~

-1 CHLIFE~
Character Lifetime:

A character has basically unlimited life.  But we have designed a system that
lets the characters not being used to die off.  The system is proportional to
the level of the player.

Maximum safe time off the game:  1 + ( character level / 3 )   in months

Example:  A player is 10th level:  1+(10/3)=  4 months realtime inactive

Any access to a character after the safe time will erase the character.
~


-1 MULTIPLAY01~
Game policy on multiplaying is a very complex subject.  We have attempted to
set up a reasonable solution, but it may take a bit of time to fine tune.

Due to various reasons the hard-code limiting system for multiplaying has been
dropped.  All future multiplaying limites will be set, controlled, and enforced
by the Barons/Baronesses.  Please see their helps for further info.

There are currently no limits on amount of players from any single site.

The following lists the modifiers for armor, or lack thereof, for each Class:
The values are the percent of body covered.  Higher values take into account
that a class has a better ability to use that particular type of armor.

Elementalist holds the same stats as the original non-differing armor system.
An item with 10% coverage is the same value as the AC of the armor.  Larger
coverage values are multiples of the basic AC of the object, such as an item
worn on the body gives three times the AC that an identify will display.

The VT102 command can be turned on and off by the commands:
VT102 ON
VT102 OFF

Simply typing VT102 will give the status of the vt102 system.

The VT102 system modifies all output to your terminal by
including information using vt102 codes.  Vt102 is nearly
compatible with vt100, but several commands might not be
implemented in the vt100 system that the VT102 system requires.
It is suggested that all systems run with VT102 on, although
it is not necessary.

~

-1 VT02~

The VT102 system allows for terminal sizes of 80 columns only.
The rows, however, may be set with any value in the range of
15 rows to 80 rows.

The VT102 command with a number for an option sets the rows
to that amount.  A refresh of the display is done during this
operation.

-1 VT03~

The VT102 system scans all outgoing data for the word 'You' in any
case, and regardless if it is nested inside another word like 
'yourself'.  This intensity change can be overridden by comands that
have defined brightness levels.

This feature is normally on by default, although the user may select
to turn it on or off at any time by issuing the commands:
VT102 BOLD
VT102 NOBOLD

The basic reasoning behind this option is that nearly all lines
of text that the game displays that relate directly to the player
contains some form of the word 'You'.  This means that lines
directly relating to the player are bold, while those that are
related to others are dim.

-1 VT04~

The VT102 system has the ability to be backward compatible with VT100
systems.  Normally this is not desirable, because the VT100 system
operates with less optimization.  Although it may be required on
various operating systems, from Mac to AIX.  It is suggested that the
user try VT102 in fast mode first, and if any wierd display problems
crop up, try VT102 in slow mode.

The commands to change the compatibility modes are:
VT102 FAST
VT102 SLOW

This symptom occurs when the terminal rows are set too low.
Try adjusting the terminal size with 'VT102 <rows>' until only

The method for changing the default characteristics of REVERSE/NORMAL
text is rather convoluted.  It is based of of the COLOR command, and
is only allowable on system that do NOT use color.

Use the 'COLOR ON' command, and change any of the types of text you
wish to make REVERSE by changing the background color to some value
besides 0, and change the forground to 0.

Finially issue the 'COLOR OFF' command to return to normal video
mode.

This will allow you to select whether you wish the status bars to be
in reverse video or normal text.

-1 RAWDATA00~
The Rawdata system allows interfaces to intercept special characters and
interpret them to get binary information on characters as the information
changes.  This system is designed for easing external interface designs and
allowing graphical interfaces, or systems of semi-automation, where character
stats are required to be understood.

It is suggested that the VT102 system be disabled when using a custom
interface.  To temporarily disable the VT102 interface, use the REQUEST commend.

This system is currently under construction, but the specifications are
formalized.

The request command temporarily changes game modes for the current session.

REQUEST V-     Temporarily turns off VT102 mode.
REQUEST V+     Turns VT102 back on after being temporarily disabled.
REQUEST P+     Temporarily turns on the Packet system.
REQUEST P-     Turns off the Packet system.
REQUEST L-     Temporarily turns off all prompt text.

This could be useful for client programs that use the Raw Data system.
Therefore the user my then change to a normal VT102 terminal, and not have to
switch modes.
~
-1 RAWDATA01~
The code sends information to the client program in the following format: 
<Initialize byte>  - a single byte of non-ascii value selects format of info.
<Index value>      - a single byte that selects which data field the info is of.
<Information>      - Various formats depending on format.
<29>               - Byte is only used on text strings to signal end.

The following is a list of the various format types and initialize byte:

-1 PACKET00~
The packet system allows much faster transfer of particular sets of text that
repeats often.  This system can also be used to recognize actions by the
client program, and use them for such things as graphic motion, or sound.

Packet Record Mode <23> sends the index and the full string, followed by a
ending byte <29>.
Packet Display Mode <24> sends only the index of the string to the client
program.

Each time a session is started, the packet list is flushed for each character.
A particular packet is sent in it's full text version only once per session.
Any subsequent sends are in the Packet Display mode.

The client program must be able to store the information from a Packet Record,
for later use by the Packet Display code.

This system is freeware, and currently in Beta format.

The MrTerm program has the following features:
  Full VT102 and ANSI color support.
  MrMud proprietary video codes, for 1.5 to 4 times faster cursor positioning
    and color changes.
  Selectable fonts and rows, but no scroll bars, and fixed 80 columns.
  Scroll back buffer.
  Saving of several configurations and dialing directories.
  Location of the terminal and scroll back buffer are saved.
  Fully documented with help menus.
  Multiple terminals with Winsock.
  Packages specific for Win3.1, and WinNT/Win95, and various processors.

The terminal package may be gotten at WWW:   http://204.162.115.56

After successful entry into Mortal Realms through the terminal system, type:
config +term
refresh
This engages the terminal system and resets the screen.
If using another terminal package issue a 'cofig -term'.

This program also works very well with BBS's and any terminal usage, as long as
no file transfer is required.  We will not be supporting any file transfering
capabilities (like xmodem, and kermit)

Only one player is allowed in the Tower at one time.  All others are blocked.
There is no time limit on completing the test.   Only five lives.
Saving is not allowed inside the Tower.

  The AUTO command automates combat in several ways.  AUTO will execute a
command continually until you run out of mana or movement for a particular
skill.  AUTO can always be interupted by typing in a new command.  The WIMPY
command will always override an automatic command.  AUTO will always start
when a player starts combat.

AUTO OFF - turns off the automatic system.
AUTO AUTO - turns on the basic automatic system.
AUTO QUICK - turns on the advanced automatic system.

  The QUICK mode modifies normal combat, by allowing double speed skills or
spells, at the cost of losing normal attacks.  This is a very good system for
spell casters.

you the number of reconnects/hour or day.  The number of reconnects should be
directly proportional to the lag present at the time of the reconnects.  If
you wish to play with less lag, you would want to connect at the times with
the fewest reconnects.  Usage defaults to the daily format.

-1 CASTLEENTRANCE~
Syntax: CASTLE entrance <dir>                          cost: $30,000,000

  This command creates the first room of your castle.  The entrance can only
be created in a room designated residential.  Once you create an entrance to
your castle, you cannot relocate.  Unless you are willing to spend the gold 
for a back door (see "Connecting rooms in your castle for more info on back
doors), you will only have one place to exit your castle.
EXAMPLE: You find a room that you want to build your castle from and that is
marked as a residential area.  To build your entrance to the east you would
enter: 
  >castle entrance dir_east
(NOTE: "castle entrance" by itself will show you a listing of dir_ flags)
And some contractors would come, take your money, and build the entrance to
your new Castle.
**NOTE** To determine if you can start a castle in the room you are in, type

a new room from an existing room in your castle.
EXAMPLE: You want to add a new room onto your entrance that extends to the
west for your guard's living quarters.  You would go to your entrance and
enter:
  >castle room dir_west

-1 CASTLECONNECT~
Syntax: CASTLE connect [<dir>] cost: $4,000,000(interior) $70,000,000+(backdoor)

  The connect command allows you to connect rooms together.  If you are
connecting rooms within your castle, it's not very expensive.  However, you are
allowed one connection from inside your castle to any other place in the world;
this connection is called a BACK DOOR.  BACK DOOR's are VERY expensive and
cannot be used as an entrance to your castle, only an exit.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The most basic idea behind creating a connection is that it
requires TWO sides.  This means that to define a connection you will have to do
the "castle connect <direction>" command TWICE, once for each side of the
connection.

EXAMPLE: You want to connect your guard's living quarters to your throne room.

Step 1) Go to your guard's quarters, and enter:
  >castle connect dir_up

**   Issuing this first "castle connect" command stores that room and dir    **
** (use "castle" with no parameters to see if you already have a first side  **
** of a connection defined and where it is) for use when you issue the 2nd   **
** "castle connect" command.                                                 **

Step 2) Then go to your throne room and enter:
  >castle connect

** (no direction is needed for the second use of connect because it just     **
** assumes the opposite of the first).  This will create a way for you       **
** to escape from your throne room into the guards quarters by going         **
** down from the throne room.  Of course, it is a two-way entrance,          **
** so your guards can come and warn you quickly if need be.                  **

NOTE: To abort a connect (clear the first side of the connection), use:
 >castle connect clear

IMPORTANT NOTE: If, for some reason, your castle's entrance is no longer
connected to the rest of the world, simply use the "castle entrance" command
to connect it to the current room you are standing in.  The limitation being
that it will only connect in the same direction as your old castle entrance.

-1 RSETEXTRA~
  This allows you to attach extra descriptions to a room in your castle.  Extra
descriptions allow a person to type "look <keyword>" and see the description
that you typed in.  Each description has a keyword and an associated
description.  You can also DELete unwanted extra descriptions (see NOTE).
To create a keyword list for a description, you would use this format:
  >rset extra keyword <keyword_list>
Then, you would attach a description to those keywords by useing this format:
  >rset extra desc <keyword> <description>
Where: <keyword> is one of the keywords listed in the <keyword_list>.
EXAMPLE: if you type the following two lines in your castle:
  >rset extra keyword stairs stairway steps
  >rset extra desc stairs The stairs are long and treacherous.
Then anyone who typed "look stairs" or "look stairway" or "look steps" in the
room that you did that in would see: "The stairs are long and treacherous."

NOTE: To DELETE an extra description, use:
  >rset extra del <keyword>

  This command lets you set the flags of the room.  Flags are used to make
rooms do special things.  For example, to make the room safe from any type
of attack (like the temples), you would use: "rset flag CROOM_SAFE"
Of course, if the flag is currently set, doing the above command would clear
it (thus making the room not safe).  To see what the current flags are in
the room, use "castle rstat".

-1 RSETDOOR~
  This command is actually a set of commands.  It allows you to change the
various aspects of the doors in the room.  Here are a few examples:

To set the door to the south to an actual opening/closing door:
  >rset door dir_south flag cex_canclose
(NOTE: "rset door dir_south flag" by itself will list valid flags)
To set it so the door to the south opens with "open gate":
  >rset door dir_south keyword gate
To set the door to the south so it says "The gate to the Lords Keep.":
  >rset door dir_south desc The gate to the Lords Keep.
To set the southern door to be lockable by something you are holding named cup:
  >rset door dir_south key cup
To DELete the southern door (see NOTE 3):
  >rset door dir_south del
NOTE 1:If you modify the entrance to your castle from the inside of your
castle (the only way you can do it), the outside of the entrance will reflect
the changes as well.  Otherwise, all changes to a door are only on the side
which you are changing them on.
NOTE 2:If you want the door you create to be shut or locked when the game
loads, make sure it's shut or locked when the area is saved.  Since you can't
force the area to save, you must make sure that the door is shut or locked
after every modification you make.  To be doubly sure, shut or lock the door
and then make a modification (like renaming a room).  Then, keep checking the
"castle" command (with no parameters) periodically until it is no longer
marked as modified.
NOTE 3:DELeting only deletes the side of the door that you are on.  The other
side is left unmodified, making it a one-way door into the room you are in.
BE SURE YOU HAVE ANOTHER EXIT TO THE ROOM THE CONNECTION GOES TO, WE WILL NOT
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU LOSING A ROOM.

Clan leaders can use the mset command to set their clan's healer and guard
mobiles. When you have finished creating a mobile (setting descriptions,
sex and name), a clan leader can use mset <mobilename> clanguard or
mset <mobilename> clanhealer to select that mobile as their clan's healer or
mobile.

-1 MCREATE~
Syntax: MCREATE                                 cost: $15,000,000
  This command is used to create a mobile AND to specify what room that mobile
is to start in when the game reboots.  Whatever room you are in when you issue
the MCREATE command will be the one which the mobile will appear in every
time the game reboots.
  The mobile created by this command is called a "Wafer golem."  It's is not
very useful until you change it using the MSET command set.

Clan leaders who have selected a clan healer or guard can use this command to 
create a mobile in the current room. After each reboot, the healer or guard
will be loaded to this room. 

Syntax is: mcreate clanguard or mcreate clanhealer.

  Here's an example of what you could do if you wanted to create a guard for
the entrance to your castle:

STEP 1) Go to your castle entrance----(where you want the guard to start at)
STEP 2) Type: "MCREATE"---------------(which creates a "wafer golem")
STEP 3) Type: "MSET golem NAME guard"
-------------------------(step 3 changed the name of the "golem" to "guard")
STEP 4) Type: "MSET guard SHORT A castle guard"
(makes it so when the guard does an action it says "A castle guard" does it)
STEP 5) Type: "MSET guard LONG A castle guard stands here."
-----(sets what you see when you look in a room where the guard is standing)
STEP 6) Type: "MSET guard SEX sex_male"-------(makes the guard a man)
STEP 7) Type: "MSET guard RACE race_ogre"
---------------makes him an Ogre that speaks Ogre)
STEP 8) Type: "MSET guard LEVEL 15"-----(makes him a level 15 mobile)
STEP 9) Type: "MSET guard ACT cact_scavenger"
-----------------------------(makes him pick up items that are on the floor)
STEP 10) Type: "MSET guard ACT cact_aggressive"
-------------------------------(makes the guard attack anyone who isn't you)

Syntax: MSET TAG                                cost: $0
  This command is used to change the name of <old name> to <new name>.  It's
most common use is to change the name of the "wafer golem" to whatever you
created the mobile to be called.

  The MSET TAG command, when used, will add the name "mob" to all of
your mobiles in the room you are in.  This is handy if you forget (or can't
figure out) the name you gave it.  This command has no parameters.

EXAMPLE: MSET golem NAME guard castle
  Would change the "golem" so that you can refer to it as "guard" or "castle"
  (so that if someone types "look castle guard" or "look guard" they will be
  shown this mobile that was renamed)

EXAMPLE: MSET guard NAME guard castle frank
  Would change the "guard" you just renamed above to be named "frank" as well
  (to help you better distinguish among your many castle guards)

-1 MSETDESC~
Syntax:  MSET <mobile name> LONG <description>   cost: $1,000,000
Syntax:  MSET <mobile name> SHORT <description>
Syntax:  MSET <mobile name> DESC 
  The LONG version of this command allows you to change the description of
the mobile that is seen when you look in a room that the mobile is in.
EXAMPLE:  MSET guard LONG The Castle Guard is standing here at attention.

  The SHORT version of the command changes the description that is seen when
the mobile does an action.
EXAMPLE:  MSET guard SHORT A Castle Guard

  The DESC version of the command changes the description of the mobile when
someone looks at the mobile. It enters you into the online editor to edit
the existing description or to create a new one.

NOTE: The LONG and DESC versions of this command do a word-wrap on strings that
are longer than the screen width.

-1 MSETLEVEL~
Syntax:  MSET <mobile name> LEVEL <new level #>  cost: $1,000,000
  Setting the level of the mobile lets you set how strong it is.  The game
automatically adjusts the hitpoints, experience, and damage that a mobile has
when you set it to a new level.

NOTE: You cannot make a mobile have a level greater than 1/2 your own level.

-1 MSETACT~
Syntax:  MSET <mobile name> ACT <cact flag>      cost: $1,000,000
  Setting the ACT of a mobile lets you tell the mobile how it should react to
certain situations.
  This command does NOT set <cact flag>'s, but it TOGGLEs them.  So, if
CACT_WIMPY is already set on your guard, then the command:

> MSET guard ACT cact_wimpy

would clear CACT_WIMPY, thus making the guard NOT be wimpy.

The allowable <cact flag>'s are:

  CACT_SENTINEL                    (the mobile will stand in one place)
  CACT_SCAVENGER          (the mobile will pick up items from the room)
  CACT_AGGRESSIVE                (the mobile will attack other players)
  CACT_WIMPY                 (the mobile will flee if it's almost dead)
  CACT_WEAK                          (the mobile cannot carry anything)
  CACT_SMART                                      (the mobile can talk)

  Socials

A social is a command that is used to convey an action that is used for
communication, such as 'laugh'.  These commands can be used to convey extra
depth to a statement, and are intended to give a visual clue to the body
language a character would normally use under person-to-person conversation.
Socials can range from funny to vulgar, and can change meaning depending on
the cercumstance of the conversation.  Socials follow no set pattern, but
have no real impact on the game.  Socials only work in the same room.

There are three modes of socials:     (examples will use the laugh command)
<social command>                              - Player will simply laugh
<social command> {your name here}             - Player will laugh at himself
<social command> {another person's name here} - Player will laugh at another

To get a complete list of all the socials at any time use the 'SOCIAL'
command.

funny.  *smile*

Spam is a command that turns off certain aspects of combat messages.
It allows those with slow links to have a more timely combat, or just to
filter out undesired combat messages.

SPAM by itself shows a list of the current settings.  It is suggested that the
player try a few of these settings before deciding on any one setup.
The default setting is everything on except the status list.

The status list shows an extra line after each combat round as to the condition
of each of the players in the current player's party.  The data shown is current
and maximum hitpoints.  This may be used by itself as an extra piece of data
with everything else on.  Or a summary when some of the other statements are
turned off.

Spam used in conjunction with CONFIG can shortened overly long combat rounds
significantly.

The following lists the abilities of a Baron or Baroness:
Commands: SLAY, SLAUGHTER, GOTO, RSTAT, MSTAT, OSTAT, HOLYLIGHT

A Baron/Baroness character, may not be murdered, but may murder anyone.
They cannot be stolen from.
They can take anything from any corpse, regardless if it's a player's corpse,
or another group's kill.
They are also required NEVER to assist in the furthering of any players.
Their job is to patrol the realm looking for anti-social players, that go
great lengths to harm others.  Not in a killing sense, but in verbal abuse,
vulgarities, harrassment, and other political problems that may exist.
They are judge, jury and executioner in this role.
It is desired that all peaceful attempts be made before any punishment takes
place.
They cannot punish someone more than once per problem, even if it affects
several people.  But punishment may resume if the guilty continues.
Barons should be the pinnacle of game politics.
Any barons found not following these guidelines we be punished severly by
the Gods.  There will usually be an equal number of barons from each God.
You should never ask to be one of the barons, because this will disqualify 
your chance of being one.

0 GUARD~
The GUARD skill gives you an enheightened awareness of the items you have in

well developed GUARD skill will prevent the majority of all attempted thefts
from your person.  Once this skill is learned, it is always in effect.

0 CAMP~
Syntax: camp

After a long, hard few minutes of taking out large and aggressive monsters,
your party needs to make a CAMP.  When you make a CAMP, you REST or SLEEP
much better.  This enables you to regain your strength (HP,MANA,MOVEMENT)
faster than mere resting on the path will.  Also, while you are camped,
all of the people who are in your group, in your current room, and are either
RESTing or SLEEPing will get the same benefits!

~

0 'ENERGY SHIFT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy shift' <target> [<value>]

This spell transfers magical energy in it's truest form to the target.
The ration of transfered energy is 1 mana for the target for each 2 expended
by the necromancer.  This value is then compared to the level difference of the
characters.  A necromancer of 80th level would give 1/10 normal mana to an 8th
level player.  The value is the amount of mana you are willing to transfer.

spell where you just type "cast illusion" will create a duplicate of yourself
for you to command around.  If you don't want a simulacrum of yourself, you
can make one of ANYONE or ANY CREATURE.  Simply be in a room with the creature
you want to make an illusion of.  For example:
  If you are in a room with "A Beastly Fido", typing:
  >cast illusion fido
  Would create an illusion of the fido that looked exactly like the Fido.
The last form of the illusion spell lets you create your own creature.  Unfor-
tunately, you will only be able to specify a short description of the creature.
Like:
  cast illusion "A Dark and Menacing Beast"
or
  cast illusion "Frank the Illusionist"

NOTE: All illusions will be 3/4 of your current level in the Illusionist guild.
~

0 BERSERK~
Syntax: berserk

This skill allows you to put away all thoughts except raw battle.  When you are
BERSERK, you will hit harder and more often.  You will also be able to channel
your adrenaline in such a way as to give you more stamina.  A side effect of
going BERSERK is that you will not be able to control your self beyond deciding
where to go and who to KILL or MURDER.

NOTE: Only PURE ranger's have the proper frame of mind to go BERSERK.
~

0 INDUCTION~
Syntax: cast 'induction' [<value>]

  This spell drains your physical strength to add to your magical strength.
You enter the amount of hit-points you wish to drain and you will gain
one-half that amount of mana.
~

0 RESTORE~
Syntax: cast 'restore' <target> [<value>]

  This spell uses large quantities of mana to heal large quantities of
hit-points on the target.  The ratio is one-half the hit-points for the mana.
You select how much mana you are willing to spend.
~

0 FORGE~
Syntax: forge <object name> <new short description>

This skill lets you take an object and alter it to make it look like something
it isn't.  A lot of the effect is based upon your shear strength of suggestion,
so the object will eventually revert to its original appearance.  If, for
example, you wanted to make a dagger look like a broadsword you would type:

> forge dagger A long, dark broadsword

Then, you could do with the "broadsword" whatever you could normally do with
the dagger, and everyone would see that you were doing it with a "broadsword."
~

0 'DETECT FORGERY'~
Syntax: N/A

Once this skill is learned, it automatically lets you determine if an object
is a forgery.
~

0 'CRITICAL HIT'~
Syntax: N/A

Once this skill is learned, you will be able to render wounds upon your enemy
that will drain him/her of his/her life's blood, slowly, but methodically.  The
wounds will heal over time and with certain "healing" spells.  This skill is an
enhancement of your KNIFE skill.

Even the best users of this skill will not be able to do it continually, but as
the opportunities arise when using his/her KNIFE skill.

It is possible for victims of critical hit to bleed to death after the 
assassin has been vanquished or the victim has somehow escaped the battle.
~

0 'MIRROR IMAGE'~
Syntax: cast 'mirror image' [<name>]

This spell creates several images of the target player (default target is the
caster).  The images make it harder for the player to be hit during combat.
What happens, is that someone (or something) that attacks the player, will
often actually attack one of the player's images instead.  This destroy's the
image, but does NOT hurt the player.  Magical attacks are not fooled by mirror
images, so all offensive spells will automatically attack the actual player.
~

0 'HALLUCINATE'~
Syntax: cast 'hallucinate' [<name>]

This COMBAT spell causes the named player to start seeing things.  The player
will no longer be able to tell who's doing something to anything.  They will
be able to see the events happen, but not exactly what the event is that is
happening.  For example, instead of the following line being seen by the
player:
         "Newguy gets the large bow."
The player might see:
         "Order gets a house plant."
~

0 TACTICAL~
  The tactical command allows you to bring up a drop down list of mobiles
that are in the room, with a number specifying the hit/hit_max ratio in
10% increments, with 'F' being Full.  The Bold names are those in your group.
There are numbers between the status and name further discussed in Combat Mode.

The tactical display also includes the top stat bar to optimize it's
performance.  This means we have added a few more features to it.
The first is a game clock, which relates time in the realm.
The second is a single letter for your current speed.

A larger display should not change transmission rate, so use the largest you
can stand.

The TACTICAL command allows you to change the size of the tactical map, with
the value '1' turning off the Tactical display.  The maximum size of the
tactical depends on your terminal display size.  The absolute maximum is
19.

0 TACT03~
Each character and creature has a distinct index assigned to them.  For players
this means that your assigned number will Never change.  For creatures, it
means that it will change for each new creature created when areas reset.
These numbers can be used to distinguish individual creatures of the same kind.

The numbers only show the last two digits, so repeating is possible, but fairly
slim chances.  These numbers normally appear between the health status and the
name of the character.

When in combat, a fighting character will display the '>' symbol followed by
another index number.  This means that thar particular character is fighting
the pointed to character.

The tactical numbers may be toggled on and off using the 'TACTICAL N' command.

The TACTICAL INDEX command allows you to change your designator from the
default number.

~

0 TACT04~
Syntax:  TACTICAL INDEX <two letter index>

The tactical index allows the player to choose 2 letters, numbers, or symbols
to replace the default value given by the tactical system.

~

0 COMPASS~
The Compass that is integrated into the Tactical map has several options.
The Compass has two sizes depending on how large your Tactical map is.

To change the width of the compass, type:
TACTICAL COMPASS <Direction Name Width>
This will change the length in characters of the words in the Compass.
The possible values for widths are:
0           :   Turns off Compass.
4 through 16:   Turns on Compass with specified widths on words.

The names of rooms have special colors that show what terrain type the room is.
To get a complete list of these types, simply type 'TACTICAL COMPASS' without
a number.

The Compass may slow down your system a bit, but it's great for exploring.

When using the compass, it is suggested to turn the AUTO_EXIT in the CONFIG
command off.

~


0 TACT02~

Future additions:

Over-view of the room showing player and mobile arrangements during
combat.  This will allow a 'chess-like' feature to the game.

~


-1 TACT05~
Syntax:  TACTICAL TOP
Syntax:  TACITCAL BOTTOM

  This command modifies the look to the tactical display.  It moves the top
status bar either to the very top of the screen or the bottom line of the
tactical display.  This command only affects the upper portion of the display.
It may be of value to shift the tactical to the bottom for clarity.
~

-1 DISPLAY~
Syntax: DISPLAY <object or mobile name>

This command works similar to looking at an object, but sends a picture
of the object instead.  This system is set up for objects and mobiles that
have defined displayable pictures. 

Looking at an object normally will say if the object has a displayable
picture.

This mode requires that the system be a IBM-PC system with a color terminal.
Any other system that has the ascii character 220 ( a half solid block ) will
also work.

The displayed image is 78 by 40 pixels with 8 colors.
This is the first bitmap graphics format for MrMud, and is fairly basic.
There are also very few objects or mobiles that incorporate this feature.

This command incorporates special features when working with MrTerm.  Notably
a much higher transfer rate.

-1 MAPCOMMAND~
Syntax: MAP [<range>]

  The map command works with the range system to give you a view or the
surrounding rooms.  It shows all open exits at each room.  The colors
represent the sector type, the same as the tactical compass.  Without a
specificed range, the map is shown at it's maximum size, but the text size is
reduced.  The range value can limit it to a shorter, but clearer, view.
~

-1 REINCARNATE~
Reincarnate System:
Syntax:  REINCARNATE <class> <race> <password>

  The reincarnate system is designed to give players near-unlimited
play length.  Essentially, it allows a maxed level player (95th) to
start the character over again.  With each successive generation of
reincarnations, the game setting gets increasingly harder, but gives
out larger gains.
  The reincarnate command only allows the player to select the
desired class.  All other stats are rerolled, similar to the character
generation system, when someone first starts playing.  The reincarnate
command may be executed successively, until the desired stats are
found.  The reincarnate command may not be issued after the character
gains even one experience point, when rerolling stats, although a 95th
level character may select to reincarnate at any time.
  The reincarnated character will lose all gold, items, and skills/spells.
But they will retain their castle.  The hours played will be maintained,
but the age will reflect the correct value for the new character.  The
amount of reincarnations a character has been through can be seen in the
FINGER command.
  There are only two places where reincarnation numerically affects the
new character, bonuses when gaining a level, and amount of experience
earned for a kill.  With each successive reincarnation, bonuses per
level will increase 33% over the basic bonus.  This includes hit, move,
and mana points, and also practices.  With each successive reincarnation
the amount of experience gained for a kill is divided by two.
  Example:  Assume a second time reincarnate.
    Normal hp gain is 9.  Actual hp gain is 15.        (hp+33%+33%)
    Normal experience is 128.  Actual exp gain is 32.  (128/2/2)
  Currently there is no fixed limit on the amount of reincarnations
a character may undergo.
~

-1 KNIGHTS~
Knights of the Realm

  Knights is a status given to those over 90th level.  Players at 90th
level are considered Squires.  There are several special rules regarding
Knights and Squires.  These rules are set up to make Knighthood a
desireable endeavor, but make it quite a challenge.

  When a player reaches 90th level, they automatically become a Squire,
with it's associated title.  Squires automatically have the ability to
talk to anyone without language barriers, which continues through to
Knighthood.  During the stewardship as a Squire, all experience gained will
be divided in half, as this experience is considered practice, and not full
battle experience.  This means that a Squire will advance rather slowly.

  When a player reaches 91st level, they become a Knight, with it's 
assigned title of 'Sir'.  As a Knight, you may act as a normal player, but
death has a special meaning.  Advancement as a Knight is a bit tougher than
normal advancement, but not as tough as a Squire, yet the status points
gained in hit points, movement, mana and practices are all double a normal
player.  The concept behind a Knight is that starting out is the hardest
part, and it is possible to be forced back down in ranking.

  Death for a 91st level Knight will cause a permanent loss in hit points, but
no other non-normal detrimental loss to the character.  This is not the case
with Knights over 91st level.  Each death of a Knight will reduce their level
by one, and subtract out hit points, movement and mana appropriate for this
death.  It is set up so that regardless if a Knight gains back their level,
they will experience a net loss in stat points.  Therefore a character may
eventually succome to a slow death by gradual weakening.  At this point, it
is suggested that the character try reincarnation, and make a better Knight.

  Further rules of engagement may apply, but a strong sense of tactics is
required to advance beyond the lowest level of Knighthood.  Even death by a
lowly dragon would be a loss of face enough to require the associated loss
of level.
~

-1 PROMPT~
The PROMPT command:
Syntax: prompt [<arguments>]

The PROMPT command is used to reconfigure the prompt display for players that
do not use the tactical information, or cannot use the VT102 support.
The player would simply give an argument of various terms.  These terms would
be directly displayed on the prompt.  The player may also determine what kinds
of information they are to receive.  To add a variable, the user would place
a '$' symbol followed by a key character that represents what the variable is.
  Key fields:     '$h'  Current Hit Points   '$H'  Maximum Hit Points
                  '$v'  Current Movement     '$V'  Maximum Movement
                  '$m'  Current Mana         '$M'  Maximum Mana
                  '$x'  Experience           '$g'  Gold
                  '$$'  Returns a single '$' symbol
Example:    prompt $h/$Hhp $vmv $xxp $g$$
   The prompted defined would be:  <35/46hp 110mv 5280xp 245$>
To reset the layout to the default, simply use 'prompt $'.
~

-1 DUMP~
Syntax: DUMP

  The dump command is a method of saying things in a batch.  It is designed to
work with MrTerm or any other terminal package to display something stored in
a clipboard, or other transfer system.  Simply issue the DUMP command and any
following lines are 'said' without having to specify a command in front of the
individual 'says'.  The character will continue to 'dump' statements into the
room until the STOP command is issued.
~

-1 MOST~
Syntax: MOST

  The most command lists who has the "most" of a particular statistic.  All
values are cleared apon restarting of the game, and are searched for with
every tick.  It's quite possible that the names listed will change as the
game progresses.
~

-1 TRAVEL~
Syntax:  TRAVEL [<direction>]

  The travel command is to assist the player in traveling long distances.  It
simplifies journeys by following a path until it reaches an intersection for a
spot that the character can no longer travel further on.  Travel can also be
used as a general movement command, but the player may past places of interest.
Travel is the fastest way to travel lag free, and many may notice that it gets
them past evil creatures better then wandering around.
  The travel direction may be reversed in mid-course, and stopped by issuing
the travel command without a direction.

.
           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Background
{030}

  The Lord is the player that has transcended the concept of a multi-user game,
and wishes to actively control the political structure of a world of anarchy.
The Lord is the player that cares more for strength and power than rank or
status.  The Lord is the player that wishes to finalize their history in a
world that has no end.
  Lords as a system is designed for those that see the game as something that
is not moving forward.  This is usually the case when a player has reached the
maximum level of Knighthood several times.  Lords as a system differs from
normal game play, in that status is gained by the summ total of the character's
stats (hit points, mana, and movement).  This, Lord's power, is the primary
system that ranks the various lords.  The Lord will never change from level 96.
A Lord's power will shift depending how whether he is victorious or defeated
in battle with other Lords.  To protect the Lord, they will gain numerous
benefits, and an entire set of willing Knights to do their bidding.  Lords 
need not fear the wrath of player killers besides the Lords that have declared
war on them.  And yes, Lords are above the jihad war of the Gods Order and
Chaos, and their status as a follower of a God remains, in a token form.

~

-1 LORD02~
.
           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Making a Lord
{030}

  Making a Lord is a simple process.  Become 95th level, and have a castle
built to your specifications.  Create a spot in your castle that you will
reign in.  Finally, use the command to turn yourself into a Lord.  This
process is relatively simple.  Yet, the consequences of these actions are
very strict.  Once you become a Lord, there is no turning back.
  Lords cannot reincarnate.  Lords do not lose a level.  Any action that would
be associated with deletions, such as a Knight's death due to old age, will
become a new form of death, retirement.  A retired Lord can be fingered to
find out what they have done in their lifetime, but they cannot be accessed in
any other fashion.  These retired Lords will be the sole occupant of their
name, and will never have to worry about cheap low-level imitators.  Although
the life of a Lord is not based on level, some will find that life before
wasn't really life at all.
  Knights should think quite a bit before embarking on a future of being a
Lord.  One of the most prized statuses of a Knight becoming a Lord is that of
a reincarnate.  And the more lives the Knight has lead, the stronger the Lord
will be.
  Once a Knight becomes a Lord, they will recieve a large and immediate bonus
to their various statistics.

~

-1 LORD03~
.
           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Liege Knights
{030}

  Lords may select Knights to be their Leige Knights.  This benefits both the
Lord and the Knight.  But it also brings hardships for the Knight.  There is
also a minor enticement for those would-be 'lone' Knights that do not wish to
follow a Lord.  Lords may attack any 'lone' Knight of their choosing.
  Upon becoming a Liege Knight, the Knight gains bonuses immediately upon their
various statistics.  This bonus is lost if for some reason the Knight does not
follow the Lord at a later date, such as a Lord's retirement, or a Lord's
displeasure with the Knight.  A Liege Knight will also gain a significant
benefit during player combat against another Knight that they are at war with,
if their Lord is currently present in the game.
~

-1 LORD04~

           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Benefits
{030}

  The benefits of a Lord are many.  The following is a list of these:

Lords may give out four times the normal limit in gold.
Lords get bonuses to combat during player battles.
Lords may create castles up to 50% larger than normal players.
Lords may carry 150 million gold coins on their person.

~

           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Requirements of a Lord
{030}

  Lords are required to do various tasks, or otherwise act different than
normal players or Knights.
Lords must enter their castle once per month, unlike normal players that need
only get on the game once per month, to maintain a castle.  Failure to do so
will result in a drop in the power of the Lord.
Lords must make kills on other Lords.  Failure to do so will also result in a
drop in the power of a Lord.  These kills are accumulative, and each kill is
worth an entire week of real-world time of leasure and relaxation.
Lords will also lose power from things such as normal death, and fleeing.  This
loss of power is larger if the battle is with a Lord, and larger yet if in
either Lord's castle.

~

-1 LORD06~
.
           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Castles of a Lord
{030}

  The castle of a Lord is undoubtedly a home.  Yet it should also serve as a
fortress.  The castle can be filled with mogile guards that attack any enemy
that enters that is from a Lord that the owner is at war with.  Normally
aggressive mobiles will not attack a Liege Knight.
The castle serves as the location where all Lord commands must be executed
from.  Liege Knights are envested in the castle's reign room.  All declarations
of war must be done in the castle.
A Lord cannot recall or otherwise exit from any castle, besides the normal
locomotion of walking.  Lords are particularly vulnerable in castles.
Lords in their own castles get a significant advantage during any battle.
Lords that die in a castle lose the largest amount of power than any other
location, with the reverse of gaining from a victory begin the largest.
  When a Lord retires, their castle is removed with them.  The Lord does have
the option to create an epitaph that will make a tome-stone with words of
their choice in the location of the castle.  This will be a permanent feature
of the game that even the lowliest of players may venture to and read.
~

-1 LORD07~
.
           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Declaration of War
{030}

  Lords may choose one other Lord to war with.  This is a battle the in not
one way, or one sided.  If any Lord declares war on another, both parties may
attack the other freely.  The game will notify the Lord or Liege Knights upon
entering the game of all current wars that affect those characters.  Also, any
player may request a list of currently active wars.
  It should be noted that a Lord may be picked by several other Lords to be
at war with.  This will produce a situation of a one-to-many battle.
~

-1 LORD08~
.
           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Siege and war tactics
{030}

  Several tactics have been deveoped by your creators, with the idea that the
discussion of these will benefit the Lord by example.  It is also assumed that
the Lords will themselves either personal tactics, or general tactics.  The
creators of Mortal Realms do not assume that any of these will be used for
any length of time.
  The most probable tactic is that of stealth.  The Lord that can catch another
unaware will most likely have the largest chance of success.
  The Liege Knights may not attack another Lord directly, but they may prove
to be of significant value during a siege.  A siege is a battle to attack
another Lord in their castle.  This may require the defeat of several or
many guards under a time constrained situation.  The Lord in this case should
follow, as the Knights clear the way.  This tactic would climax with the two
Lords engaging in combat.  This tactic may prove to be common, in that it does
give the most gain in Power for the victorious Lord.
  With a ranked system of Lords based on power.  The strongest will most likely
develope a large force of Liege Knights.  This will most likely make them a
target of war by other Lords, that realize that they will gain more power by
killing a stronger Lord than a weaker one.  There may also be battle to gain
the status of the power given by higher ranks.
~

-1 LORD09~
.
           {150}                  Lords of the Realm
                                 Ranks of Lords
{030}

  Lords will usually start out as minor nobility.  Although this is not
necessarily true.  A Lord's rank and title will be determined by his or her
power.  The strongest of the Lords will be named King or Queen, with various
other titles bestowed upon the few upper ranked Lords.  This rank will also be
their title.  There will be only one King or Queen of Mortal Realms, and
although they do not have the ruling power of such a figure, they will have all
the respect and prestege of the most powerful denizen of the world.
  It may seem obvious in such a world of anarchy and savage battle, but the
nobility of Mortal Realms will most likely have a short life span.  Although
if they are strong enough, the ability exists to live forever as the ultimate
player.
~

-1 'MAGE BLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'mage blast' <target>

  Mage blast is a very powerful spell.  It reduces the magical defensive
strength of creatures and characters.  This spell is so powerful that it may
only be cast once on any creature during a fixed amount of time.  If the spell
is successful, then the victim is more open to magical attack.  If the spell is
a failure, then the aura of the mage blast will remain around the target, but
it will not effectively cause any damage.  This spell is relatively fast in
casting time, but costs a significant amount of mana.
~

-1 MARTIALARTS 'MARTIAL ARTS'~
Syntax:  martialarts

   Martial arts is a form of advanced attack for Rangers.  This is not a single
type of attack, but an entire group.  During the course of advancing through
the various levels, the Ranger will aquire the ability to use new forms of
martial arts attacks.  During combat, the ranger may not always be in the
position to use the most powerful martial arts attack.  It should be noted
that the weaker attacks are most the commonly employed, but the weakest
martial arts attack is still stronger and faster than a basic kick.

You cannot concentrate enough while berserk to use martialarts.
~

-1 CLIMB~
.
  Climb skill is the ability to climb rocky terrain that a character may fall
from.  Falling from terrain may be deadly.  Climbing skill is a significant
benefit to traversing this type of terrain, as it is usually windy so that any
flying spell serves no value.  Normal characters must rely on their dexterity
to get them up or down a cliff, while Rogues have the added benefit of the
practice and training of the climb skill.
~

-1 'BREATH WATER'~
Syntax:  cast 'breath water' <target>

  This spell lets the target breath water as if it was air.  This is a
manditory spell for the traversal of underwater areas, as most people can't
normally breath water.  This spell, similar to astral travel, can be cast
upon the target repeatedly, with each cast replenishing the 'air supply'.
Although the effects are not cumulative, they don't let the character choke
on water at any time.
~

-1 CONFUSION~
Syntax:  cast 'confusion' <taget>

  The confusion spell makes the victim occasionally get confused during combat
and attack the handiest body available.  This may be another party member, or
some innocent creature that just happens to be wandering through.  Confusion
is only partially effective as a means to divert attacks, yet is quite handy
against a group of creatures, with few on the casting side, as odds should
point out that there are more bodies to attack on the victim's side.
~

-1 'MAKE POISON' MAKEPOISON~
Syntax:  makepoison <type> <color> <object>

  The Make Poison skill allows an assassin to put together a batch of various
types of materials, and brew up a very vile poison.  This poison may be placed
upon weapons, ammo, food and drink.  This is quite possibly one of the nastiest
of all abilities in the Realm.
  TYPE is either 'CLEAR' for players or 'MURKY' for mobiles.
  COLOR is one of:
      BLUE   - Slow duration poison of strong strength.
      GREEN  - Combination instant and slow duration.
      PURPLE - Instant damage without duration.
  OBJECT is the object that the poison is being placed upon.
  This skill is not only hazardous to make use of, but also the final use of
the poison is hazardous.  If the assassin fails in the task of creating the
poison, it ends up affecting the assassin immediately.  Only the assassin may
see and use the poison weapons that they have created.  Since each assassin is
unique, this applies to other assassins as well.  Poisons applied to ammo will
affect the victim at approximately one-half normal damage.  Each object may
have only one dosage, yet a creature or player may be affected by numerous
poisons.  Miss-matching the TYPE of poison will cause one-half damage.
  If an assassin manages to kill a player with poison, he will be credited
with a kill as normal. A smart player will not accept weapons, food, or
generally anything from assassins, as they may have a bit of vile poison 
accidently boobie-trapping the innocent player.
~


-1 SANCTIFY~
Syntax:  cast sanctify

  The Santify spell allows the monk to bless an entire room with the spirit of
their God.  It dis-allows violence to be initiated, or damaging spells to be
cast.  There is a time limit on the duration of this 'safety', but generally
in the range of about one game day.

-1 RACEWAR02~
.                    {130}Background of Race Wars{050}

  As with any mixed community of races, problems do arise.  There are those
that wish to vent their frustrations in the form of physical combat.  Various
races of Realm have resented each other, and now are forming into armies.
These armies march individually against their chosen mortal enemy.  This
system will operate similar to the God wars that have been going on for eons.

  The commands involved in this war are quite simple.  The RACE command will
show a brief list for a selected class showing who has killed whom recently.
The ARMY command will allow you to both join, resign, and get some information
on your army as it stands.  The MURDER command will contribute it's best to
make life messy for the enemy.  All limitations that apply to the God wars will
apply to Racial Combat.

  Joining the Army of your race is a one-time operation.  You may join at any
time you wish, after level 10.  You may resign any time after that, but after
resigning you may never join again.  There is basically no inherent structure
to the organization of these armies, and it is left up to each race to decide
their ranking, or if they want ranking at all.  While in the army of your race,
your race field in the WHO command will be highlighted and capitalized to mark
your aggressiveness.  Joining the army is quite a simple operation, requiring
you only to find the army headquarters, and execute the necessary commands.
There is no fee to these operations, as armies are always in need of a few
good men and women.

 There are some interesting feuds that have arisen between some races,
though a race's enemy will change from time to time.  

  The ongoing wars:

  Gnomes war with Drows 
    A deep seated enmity has developed between these races.  Both having great
    arrogance but with equally great ambitions and abilities has lead to the
    most violent of the wars.

  Dwarves fight with Orcs
    Both races historically occupy the same limited territories of caverns and
    mountain holds.  This enevitibly lead to bloodshead on a massive scale,
    due mainly to both race's stubbornness to yield ground.

  Elves combat with Ogres
    Denizens of the forest, both.  Ogres of old chose elves as a staple diet.
    The elves in return seemed to dislike this and responded inkind.  Elves
    and ogres are not usually found massing armies, but they do tend to kill
    each other when given the chance.

  Halflings battle the Humans
    Reputedly begun by a social blunder on the part of their two kings, the
    Humans and Halflings have engaged in a sort of 'cold war' of limited
    combat.  Trade between these races are known to cause extreme headaches on
    the part of the two parties.  The kind that doesn't cure in this life.

It can be said that there are no rules to war.  To emphasize this, the
struggles seen in the history of the Realm have shifted, and now battles
sprout up almost every month.  The most that can be said is that there is
celebration in victory and gloom in defeat.  Consult the WAR command to
see with whom the races are at war with.

on life than the more bloodthirsty clans.

-1 COLORS~

  Custom color may be added to certain strings.  Player descriptions and Clan
descriptions may all have custom color.  Adding color is as simple as adding
a pair of matching brackets, with three digits between them.  The three
numbers are the parameters of the color change request.

Format:    '{abc}'           with a, b, c being parameters.

    Parameter 'a':  VT102 code.
                       0 - Dim
                       1 - Bold
                       3 - Restore color to text default regardless of
                                the b/c parameters
                       4 - Reverse
                       5 - Underline
                       7 - Flashing
         (All VT102 systems support Dim, Bold, Restore, and Reverse)

    Parameter 'b':  Foreground color
    Parameter 'c':  Background color
                       0 - Black
                       1 - Red
                       2 - Green
                       3 - Yellow
                       4 - Blue
                       5 - Purple
                       6 - Cyan
                       7 - White
    
Example:   
The small (130}dog(300} sits by the (164}cat.(020}
The small {130}dog{300} sits by the {164}cat.{020}

  This example starts with normal colors.  'dog' is bold, yellow on black.
The 'cat.' is light cyan text on dark blue.  In the example showing a
starting "(" instead of "{", the reason is that this "help text" is color
active and would have interpereted.
~

-1 muffle~
{171}muffle{300}
The assassin is a character who relies on stealth and silence to kill his
prey.  Unfortunately even the strongest of prey will cry for help, alerting

An assassin is a char who specializes in offense, not defense.  Attack
quickly and get away before help arrives.  Sometimes hunters will arrive
unexpectedly, making it tough on the poor assassin.  Skilled assassins
have developed a skill to escape unwanted attacks, using a substance called
flash powder.  The assassin must first go to a guild and create this powder
with the command 'makeflash'.  Once a powder is created, he/she/it can
escape an initial murder attempt, but not always.  If used successfully,
the assassin escapes the attack, and blinds his attacker in blinding flash.
  Use of this skill is automatic, as long as you have made a flashpowder.
~

-1 'pass without trace'~
{171}Pass without trace{300}

Syntax:  Sneak

Highly experienced assassins have learned to cover their tracks so well,
