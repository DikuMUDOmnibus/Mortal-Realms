Deep in the Grassy Swamp~
The idea of waterways seems to be a falicy here.  They are not so much
waterways as grassways.  The only differences between the water and the shore
is that the water is wet, and the shore has even more grass than the water.
You cannot see anywhere.~

Shallow Water~
You are just on the southeastern edge of the swampland.  You can see an
island of sorts to the north and grass to the west.  Other than that, all
there is to see is water--muddy water.~

Shallow Water~
You are in some water which seems a little less muddy than most of the
water in the swampland.  It seems to come from a creek to the northeast, and
it flows mostly to the south.  Here the clear water is getting mixed with the
muddy water of the swamp.  The ocean reaches out southward.~

Shallow Water~
This is actually pretty clear water.  The only place north of here with
clearer water is the swift river north of the whole swamp.  Even the creek to
the north seems slightly muddier than here.  To the south and west you see
only water.  Northwest of here there is a small patch of land.  To the east,
there is a startling forest.  It seems quite out of place as though it were
here for some supernatural reason.~

On the Shore of a Small Island~
This is actually solid ground.  Unlike the rest of the land in the swamp,
the ground here is made up of solid dirt and stone rather than mud and sand.
There is a pretty steep incline here leading up to the southwest.  From there
you should be able to get a pretty good view.~

Nearly Clear Water~
You are in some water which looks almost clear.  It is pretty muddy, but
you can tell that it is quite deep here.  The ocean is just south of here.
An tall island is to the west, and a smaller island is to the north.  It gets
pretty grassy to the north and east from here.~

Nearly Clear Water~
You are in some water which is still muddy, but clearer than most of the
water in the swamp.  The grass immediately to your north must help to filter
the water.  To the south is the ocean, and to the west, you can see a very
tall island.~

You are in some water which is only slightly muddy.  The thick grass to

Nearly Clear Water~
You are in some water which looks pretty clear.  It seems to be at least
six or seven feet deep.  North of here, there is some thick grass.  To the
east, there is more water and a small sandbar.  The ocean lies to the south.~

The Top of a High Cliff~
You have walked a very long distance up one of the two trails leading
here.  It is a dead end, but well worth the sight.  When you look to the
northwest, you can even see MidGaard.  To the west, you see tangled trails
of swampland and swampwater.  It seems like a very simple pattern from here.
To the immediate north, you see a fairly small island--only slightly smaller
than the one you are now on.  To the northeast, you see a small sandbar.
Just past that bar is a small creek which has only one place to land on its
far bank.  Past that, there is a thick, dark forest.  The only things you can
see in the forest are the top of a huge mushroom to the east and some kind of
building.  Perhaps it is some little city deep in the woods.  As you look to
the south, all you can see is water at first.  It seems almost as though
there is something out there, but you cannot be certain.~

Krull's Hangout~
There are a lot of strange glowing boxes around here.  Some of them have
greenish writing on them.  A few have many colored shapes and writing.  Most
of them have some kind of board with little square things all over them.
There are many long strange strings strewn about with some sense of purpose
which no one of this world would understand.  The boxes around his tables and
floor give off a strange humming sound.~
