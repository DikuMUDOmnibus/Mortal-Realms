THE STORY OF ARACHNOS
The following story has been intimated to travellers and has survived 
as heresay through a long lineage of monastic bards:

Legend has it that 3000 years ago, the Great King R'edips, ruler of the
ancient Kingdom of Neldoras, married a beautiful, young lady. The King was
a kind and generous man, and though he would grow no more righteous than
before, he gladly shared his wealth with the people, incurring many
sacrifices and living in a castle with less than 20 rooms.

His wife, the Queen of Neldoras, known in lore as Queen Autumn, did not
agree with the generosity of her mate. It was her belief that the King
should not spend his wealth on the people, rather that the people's
purpose was instead to increase the noble lot of their soveriegn. King
R'edips dismissed the ideas of his beautiful Queen with the brashness of
youth and vigor and presumed that her ideas would fall into their correct
place with the passage of time and the benefit of experience.

But the noble King's prophesy failed to bear fruit. Instead, Queen Autumn
grew even more convinced of her position with each passing year. In
secret, she devised and executed a plan to have the King poisoned. But
heed! High above the small kingdom watched the ageless Lord Order and his
sage angels. Enraged by the Queen's actions, he turned her into a
spider-like creature so as to mimic the ghastly spiders which eat their
mates.

Filled with evil rage and tremendous anger, Queen Autumn drew an
alliance with the evil Spider Empress known as Arachnos. Together, they
spawned a million venomous spiders and dispatched them throughout the
Realm to attack the holy forces of Lord Order. Order, busy fighting the
celestial wars against Chaos, was prevented from stopping her advance for
some time. But when the neutral peace ensued and Order was free from
distraction, he dispatched the High Priest Ka'ar to punish Queen Autumn
for her trespasses and destroy her army of spiders.

Queen Autumn and her minions were no match for Ka'ar, a knight of heroic
repute and skill. Queen Autmun retreated into the depths of the Empress's 
kingdom, Arachnos. Ka'ar followed with speed and conviction, but he was
forced to abandon his hunt after learning of the advancement of the
legions of Chaos. His skill was needed elsewhere, but before leaving, he
casted a powerful spell on the Spider Queen, imprisoning her in Arachnos
for the ensuing 3000 years.

Ka'ar, it is said, was slayed in the horrible celestial wars but it is
rumored that the evil Spider Queen still lives in the prison of Arachnos,
swearing revenge and waiting for her opportunity to wreak havoc.

A Link in the Ethereal Web~
This is another link in the ethereal web.  Various creatures
seem to get caught (or hypnotized) by its sticky strands.  To
the north you sense the heavy breathing of a fiery animal.~

Yevaud's Lair~
Yevaud, the Usurper of Chakkor, resides here.  A voice cries
out, "BEWARE, the Usurper of Chakkor lives here!  FLEE while you can!"
But even Yevaud has his master...or so you deduce.~

A Link in the Ethereal Web~
This is another link in the ethereal web.  Various creatures
seem to get caught (or hypnotized) by its sticky strands.  A single
spider line lies to the north, while ghastly seemings are due
southward.  The grim entrance of Arachnos' Lair is downward.~

Entrance to the Donjonkeep~
A dark path at the end of the web strand, you see ahead
a torch lit chamber where the souls of unavenged adventurers
come and gnash their teeth.  The howls and screams of many echo
through the hall ways.  You see one definite path ahead.~

Realm of the Hopeless~
Here you see many misguided souls who think they still live.
They search for those who killed them without warrant, and seek the
free souls of living beings to inhabit and perhaps adventure once
more.~

The Donjonkeep~
No souls have ever lived in this place.  The wails of slaves
and the howls of wolves are the only way you can describe the sounds
you hear.  The walls are thin and wispy.  The only light you receive
is the shimmering from the strand of the ethereal web you used to get
here.~

The Single Spider Line~
A single spider line supports you once more.  As you look
across the ether you seen a single shack up ahead with a light in
the window.  You sense a great evil coming from the east and feel
inclined to go back on the ethereal web and take your chances there.~

Here you see evidence of a vagrant's abode.  The shack is to the
east, if you dare enter it.  You get the sneaking feeling you should
go back now.  The skies above you darken and roar with the laughter
of thunder.~

Mahatma's Inescapable Trap~
Mahatma, that silly thief, is here, and he steals everything you
have.  He says, 'Here, have a quick trip to the Temple of Chakkor.'
He plunges a black dagger into your back ...~

The spider's nest~
You are stuck in the middle of a very sticky web.  Your movements are limited
and there is no chance of you climbing back up to escape.  Several web covered
skeletons liter the floor here adding to your growing sense of impending doom.
Hundreds of eggs are spread throughout the nest, some seem to be hatching...~

The Sticky Chamber~
You can still bail out since your knees are shaking from the
anticipation (or is it fear?).  The sky is clear on this strand of
web, surprisingly unsticky.  The strand does not vibrate like the
others.  A few ballooning spiders pass by, cackling "You're gonna
die, you're gonna fry.  Good bye!"~

the webwork.  Perhaps lists of victims?  You can't tell.~

The Lair of Arachnos~
This is the lair of the Empress Spider, Arachnos.  A lavishly
adorned rainbow web, her lair allows her to move to any universe
she wishes by using her magical strands to the Prime Material Plane.
Coffers upon coffers of gold, magical jewels and gems await.  Unfor-
tunately Arachnos is a baggy spider too, and webs all her treasures
to her beautiful silken body.~
