DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD
This dangerous area is the fighting grounds of the Ogres and the Trolls,
two rival gangs of belligerent repute. A band of vigilante watchmen do
their best to patrol against violence and vandalism, but they are sorely
outnumbered. Be careful not to get involved in the dangerous fighting that
often takes place here.

A Dark Alleyway~
The walls of the alleyway have been spray-painted over many times
over the years.  One section of graffiti actually looks legible,
it says:    This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 15 please don't expect much fun.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
Another section of graffiti says "Raff Rules!"
There is a boulevard to the east and Wall Road East is to the west.~

This section of town has been overrun by the Troll gang.  Even the

a nice lower-middleclass neighborhood, but know the gangs run the
streets.  All the shops and homes have been boarded up and abandoned.
An alleyway is to the west and the street continues east.  An over-

NO MAN'S LAND~
This is the section of town between the two gang's territories.  This
is usually where the violence starts.  No Man's land continues north,
east, and west; or there is a street to the south.~

A small ruined chapel~
This was a small temple built to honor the minor gods and goddesses.
It is now desecrated by graffiti and vandalism.  Perhaps its worst
defilement is that it is the hangout of the Ogre gang.  There is a street to
the east through a rusty metal door.~

but then you sense a aura protecting it.  Achilles runs east

What is left of the weaponshop~
It doesn't even look like those punks gave the weaponsmith a
proper burial.  But what a going away present he seems to have
received!  Blood is splattered and dried all over the walls here.
It looks like a great deal of carnage happened here.  The way
out to the east leads out onto a street.~

Not really a "park" as you and i would think of it but
it seems queerly peaceful here in comparison to the rest of
the area.  There seems to be some kind of memorial to the
great Mongol warrior Khan being crudely constructed here.
There is a street to the east and another to the south.~
