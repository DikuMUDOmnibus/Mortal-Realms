A narrow trail through the deep, dark forest~
You are on a dusty trail winding its way westwards just below huge sticky
wires suspended like ropes between the trees.  To the west the path seems to
be completely covered in a giant web made from huge threads covered with glue.
This place gives you the creeps.~

The Den of the Queen Spider~
You are inside a cave-like structure that seems to be made entirely from

it hard to breathe the foul air that lingers here.  The walls are covered with
open cocoons.~
