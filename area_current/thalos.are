-1 THALOS~
{170}Thalos
------

Not yet a ghost town, Thalos is now only a grisly parody of its
former self.  The mysterious downfall of so great a city should be
warning to us all.  Adventurers straying within the walls of Thalos
should not expect a friendly greeting.  Those of level 10 or lower
should avoid this place--or if they must enter, go with stout companions.
Awful creatures still inhabit the ruins; consider carefully before
attacking.  Thalos can be found be taking the southerly route from
Chakkor, and then going west at the T-intersection.

The looter~
An unsavory-looking youth is here, looting what little is left in this ruin.~
You see a teenaged hoodlum gleefully grabbing the few odds-and-ends that
have been left behind and smashing what he cannot carry away.  He seems to
have no regard for his personal safety.~

A pitiful woman cowers here. She throws her bruised arm up to shield herself
from a blow or a kick.  Her eyes are wild and she seems incapable of speech--
instead she makes an improbably high keening sound that communicates fear
and panic more effectively than words ever could.  This was once a proud
citizen of Thalos...now she is more like a beaten animal.~

in this squalid little cell, and the shackles themselves have the
ability to cause pain.  You notice that the Mayor is casting all the spells
that healers and priests in temples often do...and it seems that the Mayor
is being forced to do this, for the spells are muttered through gritted teeth.~

You see that the east end of this tunnel is blocked with rubble--looks like
the passage caved in recently.  Upon looking closer however, you notice
that some of the debris has been placed carefully as if to block the
tunnel purposely.  You cannot help but wonder whether you are being 
prevented from going east or if someone has tried to block out whatever
might enter here from the other side of the cave-in.  You hear a faint
scuffling noise.~
