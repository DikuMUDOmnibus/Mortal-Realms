If you don't mind The Land of Ghald loading at 6400-6499 then only 
  do steps 1, 3, and 4. 
0) load all of the Ghald files into a directory under the directory that
  contains your "tinyworld.*" files
1) for "ghald.c", "ghald.?d", and "ghald.?i" read the comments at the beginning 
  of the files and do as they say.
2) for "ghald.h" read the comments in it and change the appropriate values
3) for "ghald.wld", "ghald.zon", "ghald.mob", and "ghald.obj" you need only 
  read them into the appropriate "tinyworld.*" files in the appropriate place.
4) modify room room #3502 (The Turning Point) so that room #6400 is to the
  South of it.  You might also want to modify the description of the Turning
  Point so it signifies something to the South.

Oh yeah, you'll need to recompile spec_assign.c and spec_proc.c after you
  modify them.
