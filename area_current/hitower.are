The chamber of darkness~
You are in a vast chamber. The walls fade into darkness, leaving you
with a very vague idea of the actual size of the room. Swirling here and
there in the dark, are patches of pure black which seem to suck in your
light and leave it that much darker here.~

Torture chamber~
You are in an ill lit chamber. Instruments of torture hang from a rack
on the wall, they seem to quiver with anticipation of a victim as if they
had a mind of their own. An operating table is here, though it is bare.
  An extreme feeling of evil permeates the entire area.~

The inner chamber~
You are in a small dark chamber. Upon the walls are glowing sigils of
dark power, scrawled and traced in an evil language no longer known to most
of this plane of existence. There is an obsidian altar here which seems to
glow, but does not shed any light, in fact it seems to be taking light in.~

You are in a long well lit hallway leading east and west. The walls here
are a milky white color, and glow with a warm luminescence, as does the
floor. A feeling of goodness permeates the area, and you feel unworthy to
tread upon these sacred floors.~

feel worthy to pass into it.~

The chamber of the white light~
You are in a vast chamber, its walls floor and ceiling are of an unknown
metallic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark. A flickering
flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of darkness and
cleansing the room of any evil. You feel a slight tug at your being as the
flame flickers towards you.~

crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and

and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.~

in the event speedy of a evacuation.~
