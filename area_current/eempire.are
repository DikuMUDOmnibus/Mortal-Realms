------------

The Elven Empire has been ruled wisely for many years by its
kings.  It has been helped by many loyal nobles doing their
part to make the Empire run smoothly.  These elves are always
looking for young elves to join the empire and help them
further the Empire throughout the realms.

This area was created by

Chara~
Chara looks expectantly at you.~
Chara is wearing a rose colored sundress with a while cotton apron ties
around it.  Her hands are callused attesting to the hard work that
country life brings.  Her countenance, however, leads you to believe
that her life is rewarding as well.~

A girl tries vainly to look older as she smiles.~
She looks to be about 13 and at the age that she wants to be a woman yet

Cole is here, working in the field.~
Cole is a strong looking man.  His face is weathered and taunt from the

firm.  He is clad in overalls and a long sleeved shirt.  In this heat,
you'd think that long-sleeves would be a bother, but they must protect
his arms from the stalks.~

The wine merchant joyously offers you a bottle. For sale of course.~
He is a jovial elf and definitely seems to enjoy his job, since he can

neck is an amulet with the symbol of the Elven empire etched in silver.~

history~
Chapter 1 History
Modern elf society began after the rift with what we commonly call Drow
or dark elves occurred.  Before that both races were part of the same
culture and were known as Sithi.  As a people, the Sithi, were long
lived, in tune with nature and in touch with their spiritual selves.
They were the best rangers and magic users of any living creature and
legend states that though very naive, the Sithi were very powerful
because of the immense knowledge they shared.  Communication between the
Sithi was a common thought process in which one could think at a
specific person or the group as a whole.~
E
great war~
Chapter 2 The Great War
When Chaos first came to the land and fought his terrible battle with
Order, several of the Sithi were turned.  They chose the path of
disharmony, which eventually led to the evolution of two distinct types
of Sithi which were the terms Elf and Drow.  Elf represented beauty,
light, order and intelligence.  Drow represented cunning, dexterity,
chaos and darkness. Over multiple generations, the knowledge of Sithi
died out and the two types merged into distinct races.~
E
legend~
Chapter 3 Legend
Most of the knowledge of the Sithi died out centuries ago, but what
little remains states that the Sithi imbibed objects with vast power and
after the Great War, many of these objects were destroyed to keep the
each other from having it.  What may be legend or may be a clue is that
the city of Ascarle was destroyed by a great tidal wave and still
sits under the sea.  An object of great power is rumored to be hidden
there and would be of great value to either race: Drow or Elves.~

A well traveled road~
A small path waves its way east as the road continues north to the gates
beyond.  Looking east a small farmhouse dots the horizon and faint
sounds of children at play carry through the musical crescendo of the
crops.  North the wall around the empire looks threatening as its
massive size is revealed more fully.~

The path is a well-beaten foot trail through the golden waves of grain
and corn that reach chest level in height.  You can get a better look at
the farmhouse now and see several children playing in the grass.  A call
from a woman's voice sends them scurrying back inside.  You must have

see that it would not be as easy to scale them as you first thought
because there is a crystalline substance in the cracks and footholds
that looks sharp and possibly deadly.  The gate swings open with a life
of its own and you pass through with an eerie feeling that if you were

wall~
The wall seems to have caved in a small amount.  There must be
a tunnel under the wall, but where does it come out?~
E
ground~
The ground is slightly raised around the edge of the wall and remains
so slightly and heads in the direction of the trees.~

There is something strange about this tree. There is something weird
at the base of the tree.~

E
base~
You can push your hand through the wood here, it must be some kind
of magic passage which you could enter.~

Riding trail~
The trail is narrow and not more than two horses could walk abreast of
each other here. The trail weaves in between trees and occasionally
there is a jump, made of wood, for the horses. A bird chirps happily in
the distance and squirrels chase one another merrily. The inner wall of
the empire can been seen through the trees.~

Riding trail~
This area of the trail seems very peaceful and the smell of wild flowers
drifts lazily to you. The trees are older in this part and have a high
canopy. Looking up you see an orchid plant. Maybe if you climbed the
tree you could fetch it. It would make a pretty gift.~

Riding trail~
A jump is in this section of the trail. It is approximately three feet
tall and looks sturdy. There is room to walk around it at the side of
the trail. The wall can be clearly seen from where you are standing.~

Waiting room~
Stylish couches made of crushed velvet line both sides of the room. A
noble woman lounges impatiently upon one. Various pages are standing
around waiting patiently for their chance to see the advisor to give him
a message from their employer.~

Staircase~
The second floor of the manor house contains the advisor's private chambers
as well as an audience hall and waiting room.  The view of the rooms below
shows the elegant craftmanship and exquisite details that went into
creating this showcase home.~

Top of the staircase~
Glass doors protect the stairs from the weather yet allow an uninhibited
view of the garden. The garden looks like a miniature rain forest that
has been besieged with flowers. Two elven maidens are in the garden
working with the flowers.~

The rooftop garden~
The garden is even lovelier now that you've entered within. The smells
are exquisite and the colors are bright and pure. The flowers are
shrouded in a mist that keeps them watered and sunlight shines down upon
them.~

Audience chambers~
The chambers are large and elegant. A stately group of elven elders are
assembled to hold court. On the dais at the head of the chambers sits
the advisor. A feeling of great power is in this room and it makes you
feel somewhat nervous but also very eager to see what lies in store.~

Field~
Rows and rows of corn are in this section of field.  They are orderly
and spaced evenly but the erratic growth has made traversing the rows
harder than it would first appear to be.~
